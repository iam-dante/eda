However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowl-\\nedge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance\\nlags behind task-speciﬁc architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their\\ndecisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-\\ntrained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric\\nmemory have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We\\nexplore a general-purpose ﬁne-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation\\n(RAG) — models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric mem-\\nory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric\\nmemory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense\\nvector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We com-\\npare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages\\nacross the whole generated sequence, and another which can use different passages\\nper token. We ﬁne-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-\\nintensive NLP tasks and set the state of the art on three open domain QA tasks,\\noutperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-speciﬁc retrieve-and-extract\\narchitectures. For language generation tasks, we ﬁnd that RAG models generate\\nmore speciﬁc, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only\\nseq2seq baseline.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nPre-trained neural language models have been shown to learn a substantial amount of in-depth knowl-\\nedge from data [47]. They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized\\nimplicit knowledge base [51, 52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down-\\nsides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can’t straightforwardly provide insight into\\ntheir predictions, and may produce “hallucinations” [38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric\\nmemory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [20, 26, 48] can address some of these\\nissues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be\\ninspected and interpreted. REALM [20] and ORQA [31], two recently introduced models that\\ncombine masked language models [8] with a differentiable retriever, have shown promising results,\\narXiv:2005.11401v4  [cs.CL]  12 Apr 2021\\n\\nThe Divine\\nComedy (x)\\nq\\nQuery\\nEncoder\\nq(x)\\nMIPS\\npθ\\nGenerator\\xa0pθ\\n(Parametric)\\nMargin-\\nalize\\nThis 14th century work\\nis divided into 3\\nsections: \"Inferno\",\\n\"Purgatorio\" &\\n\"Paradiso\"         (y)\\nEnd-to-End Backprop through q and\\xa0pθ\\nBarack Obama was\\nborn in Hawaii.(x)\\nFact Veriﬁcation: Fact Query\\nsupports (y)\\nQuestion Generation\\nFact Veriﬁcation:\\nLabel Generation\\nDocument\\nIndex\\nDefine \"middle ear\"(x)\\nQuestion Answering:\\nQuestion Query\\nThe middle ear includes\\nthe tympanic cavity and\\nthe three ossicles.

We combine a pre-trained retriever (Query Encoder + Document\\nIndex) with a pre-trained seq2seq model (Generator) and ﬁne-tune end-to-end. For query x, we use\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) to ﬁnd the top-K documents zi. For ﬁnal prediction y, we\\ntreat z as a latent variable and marginalize over seq2seq predictions given different documents.\\nbut have only explored open-domain extractive question answering. Here, we bring hybrid parametric\\nand non-parametric memory to the “workhorse of NLP,” i.e. sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models.\\nWe endow pre-trained, parametric-memory generation models with a non-parametric memory through\\na general-purpose ﬁne-tuning approach which we refer to as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\\nWe build RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq transformer, and the\\nnon-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural\\nretriever. We combine these components in a probabilistic model trained end-to-end (Fig. 1). The\\nretriever (Dense Passage Retriever [26], henceforth DPR) provides latent documents conditioned on\\nthe input, and the seq2seq model (BART [32]) then conditions on these latent documents together with\\nthe input to generate the output. We marginalize the latent documents with a top-K approximation,\\neither on a per-output basis (assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens) or a per-token\\nbasis (where different documents are responsible for different tokens). Like T5 [51] or BART, RAG\\ncan be ﬁne-tuned on any seq2seq task, whereby both the generator and retriever are jointly learned.\\nThere has been extensive previous work proposing architectures to enrich systems with non-parametric\\nmemory which are trained from scratch for speciﬁc tasks, e.g. memory networks [64, 55], stack-\\naugmented networks [25] and memory layers [30]. In contrast, we explore a setting where both\\nparametric and non-parametric memory components are pre-trained and pre-loaded with extensive\\nknowledge. Crucially, by using pre-trained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is\\npresent without additional training.\\nOur results highlight the beneﬁts of combining parametric and non-parametric memory with genera-\\ntion for knowledge-intensive tasks—tasks that humans could not reasonably be expected to perform\\nwithout access to an external knowledge source. Our RAG models achieve state-of-the-art results\\non open Natural Questions [29], WebQuestions [3] and CuratedTrec [2] and strongly outperform\\nrecent approaches that use specialised pre-training objectives on TriviaQA [24]. Despite these being\\nextractive tasks, we ﬁnd that unconstrained generation outperforms previous extractive approaches.\\nFor knowledge-intensive generation, we experiment with MS-MARCO [1] and Jeopardy question\\ngeneration, and we ﬁnd that our models generate responses that are more factual, speciﬁc, and\\ndiverse than a BART baseline. For FEVER [56] fact veriﬁcation, we achieve results within 4.3% of\\nstate-of-the-art pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision. Finally, we demonstrate that\\nthe non-parametric memory can be replaced to update the models’ knowledge as the world changes.1\\n2\\nMethods\\nWe explore RAG models, which use the input sequence x to retrieve text documents z and use them\\nas additional context when generating the target sequence y. As shown in Figure 1, our models\\nleverage two components: (i) a retriever pη(z|x) with parameters η that returns (top-K truncated)\\ndistributions over text passages given a query x and (ii) a generator pθ(yi|x, z, y1:i−1) parametrized\\n1Code to run experiments with RAG has been open-sourced as part of the HuggingFace Transform-\\ners Library [66] and can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/\\nexamples/rag/. An interactive demo of RAG models can be found at https://huggingface.co/rag/\\n2\\n\\nby θ that generates a current token based on a context of the previous i −1 tokens y1:i−1, the original\\ninput x and a retrieved passage z.\\nTo train the retriever and generator end-to-end, we treat the retrieved document as a latent variable.\\nWe propose two models that marginalize over the latent documents in different ways to produce a\\ndistribution over generated text. In one approach, RAG-Sequence, the model uses the same document\\nto predict each target token. The second approach, RAG-Token, can predict each target token based\\non a different document. In the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the\\npη and pθ components, as well as the training and decoding procedure.\\n2.1\\nModels\\nRAG-Sequence Model\\nThe RAG-Sequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate\\nthe complete sequence. Technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that\\nis marginalized to get the seq2seq probability p(y|x) via a top-K approximation. Concretely, the\\ntop K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence\\nprobability for each document, which are then marginalized,\\npRAG-Sequence(y|x) ≈\\nX\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))\\npη(z|x)pθ(y|x, z) =\\nX\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))\\npη(z|x)\\nN\\nY\\ni\\npθ(yi|x, z, y1:i−1)\\nRAG-Token Model\\nIn the RAG-Token model we can draw a different latent document for each\\ntarget token and marginalize accordingly. This allows the generator to choose content from several\\ndocuments when producing an answer. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the\\nretriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document,\\nbefore marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we deﬁne:\\npRAG-Token(y|x) ≈\\nN\\nY\\ni\\nX\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))\\npη(z|x)pθ(yi|x, z, y1:i−1)\\nFinally, we note that RAG can be used for sequence classiﬁcation tasks by considering the target class\\nas a target sequence of length one, in which case RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token are equivalent.\\n2.2\\nRetriever: DPR\\nThe retrieval component pη(z|x) is based on DPR [26]. DPR follows a bi-encoder architecture:\\npη(z|x) ∝exp\\n\\x00d(z)⊤q(x)\\n\\x01\\nd(z) = BERTd(z), q(x) = BERTq(x)\\nwhere d(z) is a dense representation of a document produced by a BERTBASE document encoder [8],\\nand q(x) a query representation produced by a query encoder, also based on BERTBASE. Calculating\\ntop-k(pη(·|x)), the list of k documents z with highest prior probability pη(z|x), is a Maximum Inner\\nProduct Search (MIPS) problem, which can be approximately solved in sub-linear time [23]. We use\\na pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. This\\nretriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to TriviaQA [24] questions and\\nNatural Questions [29]. We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory.\\n2.3\\nGenerator: BART\\nThe generator component pθ(yi|x, z, y1:i−1) could be modelled using any encoder-decoder. We use\\nBART-large [32], a pre-trained seq2seq transformer [58] with 400M parameters. To combine the input\\nx with the retrieved content z when generating from BART, we simply concatenate them. BART was\\npre-trained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions. It has obtained\\nstate-of-the-art results on a diverse set of generation tasks and outperforms comparably-sized T5\\nmodels [32]. We refer to the BART generator parameters θ as the parametric memory henceforth.\\n2.4\\nTraining\\nWe jointly train the retriever and generator components without any direct supervision on what\\ndocument should be retrieved. Given a ﬁne-tuning training corpus of input/output pairs (xj, yj), we\\n3\\n\\nminimize the negative marginal log-likelihood of each target, P\\nj −log p(yj|xj) using stochastic\\ngradient descent with Adam [28]. Updating the document encoder BERTd during training is costly as\\nit requires the document index to be periodically updated as REALM does during pre-training [20].\\nWe do not ﬁnd this step necessary for strong performance, and keep the document encoder (and\\nindex) ﬁxed, only ﬁne-tuning the query encoder BERTq and the BART generator.\\n2.5\\nDecoding\\nAt test time, RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token require different ways to approximate arg maxy p(y|x).\\nRAG-Token\\nThe RAG-Token model can be seen as a standard, autoregressive seq2seq genera-\\ntor with transition probability: p′\\nθ(yi|x, y1:i−1) = P\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x)) pη(zi|x)pθ(yi|x, zi, y1:i−1) To\\ndecode, we can plug p′\\nθ(yi|x, y1:i−1) into a standard beam decoder.\\nRAG-Sequence\\nFor RAG-Sequence, the likelihood p(y|x) does not break into a conventional per-\\ntoken likelihood, hence we cannot solve it with a single beam search. Instead, we run beam search for\\neach document z, scoring each hypothesis using pθ(yi|x, z, y1:i−1). This yields a set of hypotheses\\nY , some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents. To estimate the probability\\nof an hypothesis y we run an additional forward pass for each document z for which y does not\\nappear in the beam, multiply generator probability with pη(z|x) and then sum the probabilities across\\nbeams for the marginals. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Thorough Decoding.” For longer\\noutput sequences, |Y | can become large, requiring many forward passes. For more efﬁcient decoding,\\nwe can make a further approximation that pθ(y|x, zi) ≈0 where y was not generated during beam\\nsearch from x, zi. This avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set Y has\\nbeen generated. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Fast Decoding.”\\n3\\nExperiments\\nWe experiment with RAG in a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. For all experiments, we use\\na single Wikipedia dump for our non-parametric knowledge source. Following Lee et al. [31] and\\nKarpukhin et al. [26], we use the December 2018 dump. Each Wikipedia article is split into disjoint\\n100-word chunks, to make a total of 21M documents. We use the document encoder to compute an\\nembedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [23] with a Hierarchical\\nNavigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [37]. During training, we retrieve the top\\nk documents for each query. We consider k ∈{5, 10} for training and set k for test time using dev\\ndata. We now discuss experimental details for each task.\\n3.1\\nOpen-domain Question Answering\\nOpen-domain question answering (QA) is an important real-world application and common testbed\\nfor knowledge-intensive tasks [20]. We treat questions and answers as input-output text pairs (x, y)\\nand train RAG by directly minimizing the negative log-likelihood of answers. We compare RAG to\\nthe popular extractive QA paradigm [5, 7, 31, 26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved\\ndocuments, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to “Closed-Book\\nQA” approaches [52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead\\nrelying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural\\nQuestions (NQ) [29], TriviaQA (TQA) [24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [2]. As\\nCT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG\\nmodel. We use the same train/dev/test splits as prior work [31, 26] and report Exact Match (EM)\\nscores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set.\\n3.2\\nAbstractive Question Answering\\nRAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive\\ntext generation. To test RAG’s natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting,\\nwe use the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 [43]. The task consists of questions, ten gold passages\\nretrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the\\nretrieved passages. We do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat\\n4\\n\\nMSMARCO as an open-domain abstractive QA task. MSMARCO has some questions that cannot be\\nanswered in a way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as\\n“What is the weather in Volcano, CA?” so performance will be lower without using gold passages.\\nWe also note that some MSMARCO questions cannot be answered using Wikipedia alone. Here,\\nRAG can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses.\\n3.3\\nJeopardy Question Generation\\nTo evaluate RAG’s generation abilities in a non-QA setting, we study open-domain question gen-\\neration. Rather than use questions from standard open-domain QA tasks, which typically consist\\nof short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating Jeopardy questions.\\nJeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity.\\nFor example, “The World Cup” is the answer to the question “In 1986 Mexico scored as the ﬁrst\\ncountry to host this international sports competition twice.” As Jeopardy questions are precise,\\nfactual statements, generating Jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a\\nchallenging knowledge-intensive generation task.\\nWe use the splits from SearchQA [10], with 100K train, 14K dev, and 27K test examples. As\\nthis is a new task, we train a BART model for comparison. Following [67], we evaluate using the\\nSQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric [42]. Q-BLEU is a variant of BLEU with a higher weight for\\nmatching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than\\nstandard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and\\none for speciﬁcity. We deﬁne factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external\\nsources, and speciﬁcity as high mutual dependence between the input and output [33]. We follow\\nbest practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation [34]. Evaluators are shown an answer and two\\ngenerated questions, one from BART and one from RAG. They are then asked to pick one of four\\noptions—quuestion A is better, question B is better, both are good, or neither is good.\\n3.4\\nFact Veriﬁcation\\nFEVER [56] requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by\\nWikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide. The task requires retrieving\\nevidence from Wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify\\nwhether the claim is true, false, or unveriﬁable from Wikipedia alone. FEVER is a retrieval problem\\ncoupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. It also provides an appropriate testbed for\\nexploring the RAG models’ ability to handle classiﬁcation rather than generation. We map FEVER\\nclass labels (supports, refutes, or not enough info) to single output tokens and directly train with\\nclaim-class pairs. Crucially, unlike most other approaches to FEVER, we do not use supervision on\\nretrieved evidence. In many real-world applications, retrieval supervision signals aren’t available, and\\nmodels that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks. We explore\\ntwo variants: the standard 3-way classiﬁcation task (supports/refutes/not enough info) and the 2-way\\n(supports/refutes) task studied in Thorne and Vlachos [57]. In both cases we report label accuracy.\\n4\\nResults\\n4.1\\nOpen-domain Question Answering\\nTable 1 shows results for RAG along with state-of-the-art models. On all four open-domain QA\\ntasks, RAG sets a new state of the art (only on the T5-comparable split for TQA). RAG combines\\nthe generation ﬂexibility of the “closed-book” (parametric only) approaches and the performance of\\n\"open-book\" retrieval-based approaches. Unlike REALM and T5+SSM, RAG enjoys strong results\\nwithout expensive, specialized “salient span masking” pre-training [20]. It is worth noting that RAG’s\\nretriever is initialized using DPR’s retriever, which uses retrieval supervision on Natural Questions\\nand TriviaQA. RAG compares favourably to the DPR QA system, which uses a BERT-based “cross-\\nencoder” to re-rank documents, along with an extractive reader. RAG demonstrates that neither a\\nre-ranker nor extractive reader is necessary for state-of-the-art performance.\\nThere are several advantages to generating answers even when it is possible to extract them. Docu-\\nments with clues about the answer but do not contain the answer verbatim can still contribute towards\\na correct answer being generated, which is not possible with standard extractive approaches, leading\\n5\\n\\nTable 1: Open-Domain QA Test Scores.

Furthermore, RAG can generate correct answers\\neven when the correct answer is not in any retrieved document, achieving 11.8% accuracy in such\\ncases for NQ, where an extractive model would score 0%.\\n4.2\\nAbstractive Question Answering\\nAs shown in Table 2, RAG-Sequence outperforms BART on Open MS-MARCO NLG by 2.6 Bleu\\npoints and 2.6 Rouge-L points. RAG approaches state-of-the-art model performance, which is\\nimpressive given that (i) those models access gold passages with speciﬁc information required to\\ngenerate the reference answer , (ii) many questions are unanswerable without the gold passages, and\\n(iii) not all questions are answerable from Wikipedia alone. Table 3 shows some generated answers\\nfrom our models. Qualitatively, we ﬁnd that RAG models hallucinate less and generate factually\\ncorrect text more often than BART. Later, we also show that RAG generations are more diverse than\\nBART generations (see §4.5).\\n4.3\\nJeopardy Question Generation\\nTable 2 shows that RAG-Token performs better than RAG-Sequence on Jeopardy question generation,\\nwith both models outperforming BART on Q-BLEU-1. 4 shows human evaluation results, over 452\\npairs of generations from BART and RAG-Token. Evaluators indicated that BART was more factual\\nthan RAG in only 7.1% of cases, while RAG was more factual in 42.7% of cases, and both RAG and\\nBART were factual in a further 17% of cases, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of RAG on\\nthe task over a state-of-the-art generation model. Evaluators also ﬁnd RAG generations to be more\\nspeciﬁc by a large margin. Table 3 shows typical generations from each model.\\nJeopardy questions often contain two separate pieces of information, and RAG-Token may perform\\nbest because it can generate responses that combine content from several documents. Figure 2 shows\\nan example. When generating “Sun”, the posterior is high for document 2 which mentions “The\\nSun Also Rises”. Similarly, document 1 dominates the posterior when “A Farewell to Arms” is\\ngenerated. Intriguingly, after the ﬁrst token of each book is generated, the document posterior ﬂattens.\\nThis observation suggests that the generator can complete the titles without depending on speciﬁc\\ndocuments. In other words, the model’s parametric knowledge is sufﬁcient to complete the titles. We\\nﬁnd evidence for this hypothesis by feeding the BART-only baseline with the partial decoding \"The\\nSun. BART completes the generation \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"The Sun\\nAlso Rises\" indicating the title \"The Sun Also Rises\" is stored in BART’s parameters. Similarly,\\nBART will complete the partial decoding \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"A\\nwith \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"A Farewell to Arms\". This example shows\\nhow parametric and non-parametric memories work together—the non-parametric component helps\\nto guide the generation, drawing out speciﬁc knowledge stored in the parametric memory.\\n4.4\\nFact Veriﬁcation\\nTable 2 shows our results on FEVER. For 3-way classiﬁcation, RAG scores are within 4.3% of\\nstate-of-the-art models, which are complex pipeline systems with domain-speciﬁc architectures and\\nsubstantial engineering, trained using intermediate retrieval supervision, which RAG does not require.\\n6\\n\\nDocument 1: his works are considered classics of American\\nliterature ...

RAG achieves an accuracy\\nwithin 2.7% of this model, despite being supplied with only the claim and retrieving its own evidence.\\nWe also analyze whether documents retrieved by RAG correspond to documents annotated as gold\\nevidence in FEVER. We calculate the overlap in article titles between the top k documents retrieved\\nby RAG and gold evidence annotations. We ﬁnd that the top retrieved document is from a gold article\\nin 71% of cases, and a gold article is present in the top 10 retrieved articles in 90% of cases.\\n4.5\\nAdditional Results\\nGeneration Diversity\\nSection 4.3 shows that RAG models are more factual and speciﬁc than\\nBART for Jeopardy question generation. Following recent work on diversity-promoting decoding\\n[33, 59, 39], we also investigate generation diversity by calculating the ratio of distinct ngrams to\\ntotal ngrams generated by different models. Table 5 shows that RAG-Sequence’s generations are\\nmore diverse than RAG-Token’s, and both are signiﬁcantly more diverse than BART without needing\\nany diversity-promoting decoding.\\nRetrieval Ablations\\nA key feature of RAG is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task.\\nTo assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever\\nduring training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks.\\nWe compare RAG’s dense retriever to a word overlap-based BM25 retriever [53]. Here, we replace\\nRAG’s retriever with a ﬁxed BM25 system, and use BM25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating\\np(z|x). Table 6 shows the results. For FEVER, BM25 performs best, perhaps since FEVER claims are\\nheavily entity-centric and thus well-suited for word overlap-based retrieval. Differentiable retrieval\\nimproves results on all other tasks, especially for Open-Domain QA, where it is crucial.\\nIndex hot-swapping\\nAn advantage of non-parametric memory models like RAG is that knowledge\\ncan be easily updated at test time. Parametric-only models like T5 or BART need further training to\\nupdate their behavior as the world changes. To demonstrate, we build an index using the DrQA [5]\\nWikipedia dump from December 2016 and compare outputs from RAG using this index to the newer\\nindex from our main results (December 2018). We prepare a list of 82 world leaders who had changed\\n7\\n\\nTable 4: Human assessments for the Jeopardy\\nQuestion Generation Task.\\nFactuality\\nSpeciﬁcity\\nBART better\\n7.1%\\n16.8%\\nRAG better\\n42.7%\\n37.4%\\nBoth good\\n11.7%\\n11.8%\\nBoth poor\\n17.7%\\n6.9%\\nNo majority\\n20.8%\\n20.1%\\nTable 5: Ratio of distinct to total tri-grams for\\ngeneration tasks.\\nMSMARCO\\nJeopardy QGen\\nGold\\n89.6%\\n90.0%\\nBART\\n70.7%\\n32.4%\\nRAG-Token\\n77.8%\\n46.8%\\nRAG-Seq.\\n83.5%\\n53.8%\\nTable 6: Ablations on the dev set.

Such tasks include open-domain question answering [5, 29],\\nfact checking [56], fact completion [48], long-form question answering [12], Wikipedia article\\ngeneration [36], dialogue [41, 65, 9, 13], translation [17], and language modeling [19, 27]. Our\\nwork uniﬁes previous successes in incorporating retrieval into individual tasks, showing that a single\\nretrieval-based architecture is capable of achieving strong performance across several tasks.\\n8\\n\\nGeneral-Purpose Architectures for NLP\\nPrior work on general-purpose architectures for NLP\\ntasks has shown great success without the use of retrieval. A single, pre-trained language model\\nhas been shown to achieve strong performance on various classiﬁcation tasks in the GLUE bench-\\nmarks [60, 61] after ﬁne-tuning [49, 8]. GPT-2 [50] later showed that a single, left-to-right, pre-trained\\nlanguage model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks.\\nFor further improvement, BART [32] and T5 [51, 52] propose a single, pre-trained encoder-decoder\\nmodel that leverages bi-directional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative\\nand generative tasks. Our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, uniﬁed\\narchitecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models.\\nLearned Retrieval\\nThere is signiﬁcant work on learning to retrieve documents in information\\nretrieval, more recently with pre-trained, neural language models [44, 26] similar to ours. Some\\nwork optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a speciﬁc, downstream task such as question answering,\\nusing search [46], reinforcement learning [6, 63, 62], or a latent variable approach [31, 20] as in our\\nwork. These successes leverage different retrieval-based architectures and optimization techniques to\\nachieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrieval-based architecture\\ncan be ﬁne-tuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks.\\nMemory-based Architectures\\nOur document index can be seen as a large external memory for\\nneural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks [64, 55]. Concurrent work [14] learns\\nto retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our\\nwork. Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over\\nfact embeddings [15, 13]. A key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather\\ndistributed representations, which makes the memory both (i) human-readable, lending a form of\\ninterpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable, enabling us to dynamically update the model’s\\nmemory by editing the document index. This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive\\ndialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via TF-IDF\\nrather than end-to-end learnt retrieval [9].\\nRetrieve-and-Edit approaches\\nOur method shares some similarities with retrieve-and-edit style\\napproaches, where a similar training input-output pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited\\nto provide a ﬁnal output. These approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including\\nMachine Translation [18, 22] and Semantic Parsing [21]. Our approach does have several differences,\\nincluding less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content from several\\npieces of retrieved content, as well as learning latent retrieval, and retrieving evidence documents\\nrather than related training pairs. This said, RAG techniques may work well in these settings, and\\ncould represent promising future work.\\n6\\nDiscussion\\nIn this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and non-parametric\\nmemory. We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We\\nfound that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, ﬁnding RAG more factual\\nand speciﬁc. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating\\nits effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model\\nwithout requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components\\ncan be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some\\nanother objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric\\nmemories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a\\nwide variety of NLP tasks.\\n9\\n\\nBroader Impact\\nThis work offers several positive societal beneﬁts over previous work: the fact that it is more\\nstrongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less\\nwith generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\\nemployed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct beneﬁt to society, for example by endowing it\\nwith a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\\neffective at their jobs.\\nWith these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge\\nsource, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be\\nemployed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [50] are valid here, although arguably\\nto a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in\\nthe news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing\\ncontent [54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the\\ncoming decades [16]. In order to mitigate these risks, AI systems could be employed to ﬁght against\\nmisleading content and automated spam/phishing.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe authors would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback on this\\npaper, as well as HuggingFace for their help in open-sourcing code to run RAG models.

We use greedy decoding for QA as\\nwe did not ﬁnd beam search improved results. For Open-MSMarco and Jeopardy question generation,\\nwe report test numbers using ten retrieved documents for both RAG-Token and RAG-Sequence,\\nand we also train a BART-large model as a baseline. We use a beam size of four, and use the Fast\\nDecoding approach for RAG-Sequence models, as Thorough Decoding did not improve performance.\\nB\\nHuman Evaluation\\nFigure 4: Annotation interface for human evaluation of factuality. A pop-out for detailed instructions\\nand a worked example appear when clicking \"view tool guide\".\\nFigure 4 shows the user interface for human evaluation. To avoid any biases for screen position,\\nwhich model corresponded to sentence A and sentence B was randomly selected for each example.\\nAnnotators were encouraged to research the topic using the internet, and were given detailed instruc-\\ntions and worked examples in a full instructions tab. We included some gold sentences in order to\\nassess the accuracy of the annotators. Two annotators did not perform well on these examples and\\ntheir annotations were removed from the results.\\nC\\nTraining setup Details\\nWe train all RAG models and BART baselines using Fairseq [45].2 We train with mixed precision\\nﬂoating point arithmetic [40], distributing training across 8, 32GB NVIDIA V100 GPUs, though\\ntraining and inference can be run on one GPU. We ﬁnd that doing Maximum Inner Product Search\\nwith FAISS is sufﬁciently fast on CPU, so we store document index vectors on CPU, requiring ∼100\\nGB of CPU memory for all of Wikipedia. After submission, We have ported our code to HuggingFace\\nTransformers [66]3, which achieves equivalent performance to the previous version but is a cleaner\\nand easier to use implementation. This version is also open-sourced. We also compress the document\\nindex using FAISS’s compression tools, reducing the CPU memory requirement to 36GB. Scripts to\\nrun experiments with RAG can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/\\nblob/master/examples/rag/README.md and an interactive demo of a RAG model can be found\\nat https://huggingface.co/rag/\\n2https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq\\n3https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\\n17\\n\\nD\\nFurther Details on Open-Domain QA\\nFor open-domain QA, multiple answer annotations are often available for a given question. These\\nanswer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer\\nannotations are used to ﬁnd matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we\\nalso make use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training\\nthe model with each (q, a) pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA,\\nthere are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets,\\nsuch as emoji or spelling variants. For TriviaQA, we ﬁlter out answer candidates if they do not occur\\nin top 1000 documents for the query.\\nCuratedTrec preprocessing\\nThe answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expres-\\nsions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20].\\nTo overcome this, we use a pre-processing step where we ﬁrst retrieve the top 1000 documents for\\neach query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision\\ntarget. If no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic: generate all possible permutations for\\neach regex, replacing non-deterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace.\\nTriviaQA Evaluation setups\\nThe open-domain QA community customarily uses public develop-\\nment datasets as test datasets, as test data for QA datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading\\ncompehension purposes. We report our results using the datasets splits used in DPR [26], which are\\nconsistent with common practice in Open-domain QA. For TriviaQA, this test dataset is the public\\nTriviaQA Web Development split. Roberts et al. [52] used the TriviaQA ofﬁcial Wikipedia test set\\ninstead. Févry et al. [14] follow this convention in order to compare with Roberts et al. [52] (See\\nappendix of [14]). We report results on both test sets to enable fair comparison to both approaches.\\nWe ﬁnd that our performance is much higher using the ofﬁcial Wiki test set, rather than the more\\nconventional open-domain test set, which we attribute to the ofﬁcial Wiki test set questions being\\nsimpler to answer from Wikipedia.\\nE\\nFurther Details on FEVER\\nFor FEVER classiﬁcation, we follow the practice from [32], and ﬁrst re-generate the claim, and\\nthen classify using the representation of the ﬁnal hidden state, before ﬁnally marginalizing across\\ndocuments to obtain the class probabilities. The FEVER task traditionally has two sub-tasks. The\\nﬁrst is to classify the claim as either \"Supported\", \"Refuted\" or \"Not Enough Info\", which is the task\\nwe explore in the main paper. FEVER’s other sub-task involves extracting sentences from Wikipedia\\nas evidence supporting the classiﬁcation prediction. As FEVER uses a different Wikipedia dump to\\nus, directly tackling this task is not straightforward. We hope to address this in future work.\\nF\\nNull Document Probabilities\\nWe experimented with adding \"Null document\" mechanism to RAG, similar to REALM [20] in order\\nto model cases where no useful information could be retrieved for a given input. Here, if k documents\\nwere retrieved, we would additionally \"retrieve\" an empty document and predict a logit for the null\\ndocument, before marginalizing over k + 1 predictions. We explored modelling this null document\\nlogit by learning (i) a document embedding for the null document, (ii) a static learnt bias term, or\\n(iii) a neural network to predict the logit. We did not ﬁnd that these improved performance, so in\\nthe interests of simplicity, we omit them. For Open MS-MARCO, where useful retrieved documents\\ncannot always be retrieved, we observe that the model learns to always retrieve a particular set of\\ndocuments for questions that are less likely to beneﬁt from retrieval, suggesting that null document\\nmechanisms may not be necessary for RAG.\\nG\\nParameters\\nOur RAG models contain the trainable parameters for the BERT-base query and document encoder of\\nDPR, with 110M parameters each (although we do not train the document encoder ourselves) and\\n406M trainable parameters from BART-large, 406M parameters, making a total of 626M trainable\\n18\\n\\nTable 7: Number of instances in the datasets used. *A hidden subset of this data is used for evaluation\\nTask\\nTrain\\nDevelopment\\nTest\\nNatural Questions\\n79169\\n8758\\n3611\\nTriviaQA\\n78786\\n8838\\n11314\\nWebQuestions\\n3418\\n362\\n2033\\nCuratedTrec\\n635\\n134\\n635\\nJeopardy Question Generation\\n97392\\n13714\\n26849\\nMS-MARCO\\n153726\\n12468\\n101093*\\nFEVER-3-way\\n145450\\n10000\\n10000\\nFEVER-2-way\\n96966\\n6666\\n6666\\nparameters. The best performing \"closed-book\" (parametric only) open-domain QA model is T5-11B\\nwith 11 Billion trainable parameters. The T5 model with the closest number of parameters to our\\nmodels is T5-large (770M parameters), which achieves a score of 28.9 EM on Natural Questions [52],\\nsubstantially below the 44.5 that RAG-Sequence achieves, indicating that hybrid parametric/non-\\nparametric models require far fewer trainable parameters for strong open-domain QA performance.\\nThe non-parametric memory index does not consist of trainable parameters, but does consists of 21M\\n728 dimensional vectors, consisting of 15.3B values. These can be easily be stored at 8-bit ﬂoating\\npoint precision to manage memory and disk footprints.\\nH\\nRetrieval Collapse\\nIn preliminary experiments, we observed that for some tasks such as story generation [11], the\\nretrieval component would “collapse” and learn to retrieve the same documents regardless of the\\ninput. In these cases, once retrieval had collapsed, the generator would learn to ignore the documents,\\nand the RAG model would perform equivalently to BART. The collapse could be due to a less-explicit\\nrequirement for factual knowledge in some tasks, or the longer target sequences, which could result\\nin less informative gradients for the retriever. Perez et al. [46] also found spurious retrieval results\\nwhen optimizing a retrieval component in order to improve performance on downstream tasks.\\nI\\nNumber of instances per dataset\\nThe number of training, development and test datapoints in each of our datasets is shown in Table 7.\\n19\\n\\n'"

wentau yih, tim rocktschel, sebastian riedel, douwe kiela facebook ai research university college london new york university plewisfb.com abstract large pretrained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve stateoftheart results when netuned on downstream nlp tasks. however, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledgeintensive tasks, their performance lags behind taskspecic architectures. additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. pretrained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit nonparametric memory have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. we explore a generalpurpose netuning recipe for retrievalaugmented generation rag models which combine pretrained parametric and nonparametric memory for language generation. we introduce rag models where the parametric memory is a pretrained seq2seq model and the nonparametric memory is a dense vector index of wikipedia, accessed with a pretrained neural retriever. we compare two rag formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, and another which can use different passages per token. we netune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledgeintensive nlp tasks and set the state of the art on three open domain qa tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and taskspecic retrieveandextract architectures. for language generation tasks, we nd that rag models generate more specic, diverse and factual language than a stateoftheart parametriconly seq2seq baseline. 1 introduction pretrained neural language models have been shown to learn a substantial amount of indepth knowledge from data 47. they can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized implicit knowledge base 51, 52. while this development is exciting, such models do have downsides they cannot easily expand or revise their memory, cant straightforwardly provide insight into their predictions, and may produce hallucinations 38. hybrid models that combine parametric memory with nonparametric i.e., retrievalbased memories 20, 26, 48 can address some of these issues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be inspected and interpreted. realm 20 and orqa 31, two recently introduced models that combine masked language models 8 with a differentiable retriever, have shown promising results, arxiv2005.11401v4 cs.cl 12 apr 2021 the divine comedy x q query encoder qx mips p generator p parametric marginalize this 14th century work is divided into 3 sections \"inferno\",

netune endtoend. for query x, we use maximum inner product search mips to nd the topk documents zi. for nal prediction y, we treat z as a latent variable and marginalize over seq2seq predictions given different documents. but have only explored opendomain extractive question answering. here, we bring hybrid parametric and nonparametric memory to the workhorse of nlp, i.e. sequencetosequence seq2seq models. we endow pretrained, parametricmemory generation models with a nonparametric memory through a generalpurpose netuning approach which we refer to as retrievalaugmented generation rag. we build rag models where the parametric memory is a pretrained seq2seq transformer, and the nonparametric memory is a dense vector index of wikipedia, accessed with a pretrained neural retriever. we combine these components in a probabilistic model trained endtoend fig. 1. the retriever dense passage retriever 26, henceforth dpr provides latent documents conditioned on the input, and the seq2seq model bart 32 then conditions on these latent documents together with the input to generate the output. we marginalize the latent documents with a topk approximation, either on a peroutput basis assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens or a pertoken basis where different documents are responsible for different tokens. like t5 51 or bart, rag can be netuned on any seq2seq task, whereby both the generator and retriever are jointly learned. there has been extensive previous work proposing architectures to enrich systems with nonparametric memory which are trained from scratch for specic tasks, e.g. memory networks 64, 55, stackaugmented networks 25 and memory layers 30. in contrast, we explore a setting where both parametric and nonparametric memory components are pretrained and preloaded with extensive knowledge. crucially, by using pretrained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is present without additional training. our results highlight the benets of combining parametric and nonparametric memory with generation for knowledgeintensive taskstasks that humans could not reasonably be expected to perform without access to an external knowledge source. our rag models achieve stateoftheart results on open natural questions 29, webquestions 3 and curatedtrec 2 and strongly outperform recent approaches that use specialised pretraining objectives on triviaqa 24. despite these being extractive tasks, we nd that unconstrained generation outperforms previous extractive approaches. for knowledgeintensive generation, we experiment with msmarco 1 and jeopardy question generation, and we nd that our models generate responses that are more factual, specic, and diverse than a bart baseline. for fever 56 fact verication, we achieve results within 4.3 of stateoftheart pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision. finally, we demonstrate that the nonparametric memory can be replaced to update the models knowledge as the world changes.1 2 methods we explore rag models, which use the input sequence x to retrieve text documents z and use them as additional context when generating the target sequence y. as shown in figure 1, our models leverage two components i a retriever pzx with parameters that returns topk truncated distributions over text passages given a query x and ii a generator pyix, z, y1i1 parametrized 1code to run experiments with rag has been opensourced as part of the huggingface transformers library 66 and can be found at httpsgithub.comhuggingfacetransformersblobmaster examplesrag. an interactive demo of rag models can be found at httpshuggingface.corag 2 by that generates a current token based on a context of the previous i 1 tokens y1i1, the original input x and a retrieved passage z. to train the retriever and generator endtoend, we treat the retrieved document as a latent variable. we propose two models that marginalize over the latent documents in different ways to produce a distribution over generated text. in one approach, ragsequence, the model uses the same document to predict each target token. the second approach, ragtoken, can predict each target token based on a different document. in the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the p and p components, as well as the training and decoding procedure. 2.1 models ragsequence model the ragsequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate the complete sequence. technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that is marginalized to get the seq2seq probability pyx via a topk approximation. concretely, the top k documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence probability for each document, which are then marginalized, pragsequenceyx x ztopkpx pzxpyx, z x ztopkpx pzx n y i pyix, z, y1i1 ragtoken model in the ragtoken model we can draw a different latent document for each target token and marginalize accordingly. this allows the generator to choose content from several documents when producing an answer. concretely, the top k documents are retrieved using the retriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document, before marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, formally, we dene pragtokenyx n y i x ztopkpx pzxpyix, z, y1i1 finally, we note that rag can be used for sequence classication tasks by considering the target class as a target sequence of length one, in which case ragsequence and ragtoken are equivalent. 2.2 retriever dpr the retrieval component pzx is based on dpr 26. dpr follows a biencoder architecture pzx exp dzqx dz bertdz, qx bertqx where dz is a dense representation of a document produced by a bertbase document encoder 8, and qx a query representation produced by a query encoder, also based on bertbase. calculating topkpx, the list of k documents z with highest prior probability pzx, is a maximum inner product search mips problem, which can be approximately solved in sublinear time 23. we use a pretrained biencoder from dpr to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. this retriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to triviaqa 24 questions and natural questions 29. we refer to the document index as the nonparametric memory. 2.3 generator bart the generator component pyix, z, y1i1 could be modelled using any encoderdecoder. we use bartlarge 32, a pretrained seq2seq transformer 58 with 400m parameters. to combine the input x with the retrieved content z when generating from bart, we simply concatenate them. bart was pretrained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions. it has obtained stateoftheart results on a diverse set of generation tasks and outperforms comparablysized t5 models 32. we refer to the bart generator parameters as the parametric memory henceforth. 2.4 training we jointly train the retriever and generator components without any direct supervision on what document should be retrieved. given a netuning training corpus of inputoutput pairs xj, yj, we 3 minimize the negative marginal loglikelihood of each target, p j log pyjxj using stochastic gradient descent with adam 28. updating the document encoder bertd during training is costly as it requires the document index to be periodically updated as realm does during pretraining 20. we do not nd this step necessary for strong performance, and keep the document encoder and index xed, only netuning the query encoder bertq and the bart generator. 2.5 decoding at test time, ragsequence and ragtoken require different ways to approximate arg maxy pyx. ragtoken the ragtoken model can be seen as a standard, autoregressive seq2seq generator with transition probability p yix, y1i1 p ztopkpx pzixpyix, zi, y1i1 to decode, we can plug p yix, y1i1 into a standard beam decoder. ragsequence for ragsequence, the likelihood pyx does not break into a conventional pertoken likelihood, hence we cannot solve it with a single beam search. instead, we run beam search for each document z, scoring each hypothesis using pyix, z, y1i1. this yields a set of hypotheses y , some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents. to estimate the probability of an hypothesis y we run an additional forward pass for each document z for which y does not appear in the beam, multiply generator probability with pzx and then sum the probabilities across beams for the marginals. we refer to this decoding procedure as thorough decoding. for longer output sequences, y can become large, requiring many forward passes. for more efcient decoding, we can make a further approximation that pyx, zi 0 where y was not generated during beam search from x, zi. this avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set y has been generated. we refer to this decoding procedure as fast decoding. 3 experiments we experiment with rag in a wide range of knowledgeintensive tasks. for all experiments, we use a single wikipedia dump for our nonparametric knowledge source. following lee et al. 31 and karpukhin et al. 26, we use the december 2018 dump. each wikipedia article is split into disjoint 100word chunks, to make a total of 21m documents. we use the document encoder to compute an embedding for each document, and build a single mips index using faiss 23 with a hierarchical navigable small world approximation for fast retrieval 37. during training, we retrieve the top k documents for each query. we consider k 5, 10 for training and set k for test time using dev data. we now discuss experimental details for each task. 3.1 opendomain question answering opendomain question answering qa is an important realworld application and common testbed for knowledgeintensive tasks 20. we treat questions and answers as inputoutput text pairs x, y and train rag by directly minimizing the negative loglikelihood of answers. we compare rag to the popular extractive qa paradigm 5, 7, 31, 26, where answers are extracted spans from retrieved documents, relying primarily on nonparametric knowledge. we also compare to closedbook qa approaches 52, which, like rag, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead relying purely on parametric knowledge. we consider four popular opendomain qa datasets natural questions nq 29, triviaqa tqa 24. webquestions wq 3 and curatedtrec ct 2. as ct and wq are small, we follow dpr 26 by initializing ct and wq models with our nq rag model. we use the same traindevtest splits as prior work 31, 26 and report exact match em scores. for tqa, to compare with t5 52, we also evaluate on the tqa wiki test set. 3.2 abstractive question answering rag models can go beyond simple extractive qa and answer questions with freeform, abstractive text generation. to test rags natural language generation nlg in a knowledgeintensive setting, we use the msmarco nlg task v2.1 43. the task consists of questions, ten gold passages retrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the retrieved passages. we do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat 4 msmarco as an opendomain abstractive qa task. msmarco has some questions that cannot be answered in a way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as what is the weather in volcano, ca? so performance will be lower without using gold passages. we also note that some msmarco questions cannot be answered using wikipedia alone. here, rag can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses. 3.3 jeopardy question generation to evaluate rags generation abilities in a nonqa setting, we study opendomain question generation. rather than use questions from standard opendomain qa tasks, which typically consist of short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating jeopardy questions. jeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity. for example, the world cup is the answer to the question in 1986 mexico scored as the rst country to host this international sports competition twice. as jeopardy questions are precise, factual statements, generating jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a challenging knowledgeintensive generation task. we use the splits from searchqa 10, with 100k train, 14k dev, and 27k test examples. as this is a new task, we train a bart model for comparison. following 67, we evaluate using the squadtuned qbleu1 metric 42. qbleu is a variant of bleu with a higher weight for matching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than standard metrics. we also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and one for specicity. we dene factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external sources, and specicity as high mutual dependence between the input and output 33. we follow best practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation 34. evaluators are shown an answer and two generated questions, one from bart and one from rag. they are then asked to pick one of four optionsquuestion a is better, question b is better, both are good, or neither is good. 3.4 fact verication fever 56 requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by wikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide. the task requires retrieving evidence from wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify whether the claim is true, false, or unveriable from wikipedia alone. fever is a retrieval problem coupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. it also provides an appropriate testbed for exploring the rag models ability to handle classication rather than generation. we map fever class labels supports, refutes, or not enough info to single output tokens and directly train with claimclass pairs. crucially, unlike most other approaches to fever, we do not use supervision on retrieved evidence. in many realworld applications, retrieval supervision signals arent available, and models that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks. we explore two variants the standard 3way classication task supportsrefutesnot enough info and the 2way supportsrefutes task studied in thorne and vlachos 57. in both cases we report label accuracy. 4 results 4.1 opendomain question answering table 1 shows results for rag along with stateoftheart models. on all four opendomain qa tasks, rag sets a new state of the art only on the t5comparable split for tqa. rag combines the generation exibility of the closedbook parametric only approaches and the performance of \"openbook\" retrievalbased approaches. unlike realm and t5ssm, rag enjoys strong results without expensive, specialized salient span masking pretraining 20. it is worth noting that rags retriever is initialized using dprs retriever, which uses retrieval supervision on natural questions and triviaqa. rag compares favourably to the dpr qa system, which uses a bertbased crossencoder to rerank documents, along with an extractive reader. rag demonstrates that neither a reranker nor extractive reader is necessary for stateoftheart performance. there are several advantages to generating answers even when it is possible to extract them. documents with clues about the answer but do not contain the answer verbatim can still contribute towards a correct answer being generated, which is not possible with standard extractive approaches, leading 5 table 1 opendomain qa test scores. for tqa, left column uses the standard test set for opendomain qa, right column uses the tqawiki test set. see appendix d

marginalization over documents. furthermore, rag can generate correct answers even when the correct answer is not in any retrieved document, achieving 11.8 accuracy in such cases for nq, where an extractive model would score 0. 4.2 abstractive question answering as shown in table 2, ragsequence outperforms bart on open msmarco nlg by 2.6 bleu points and 2.6 rougel points. rag approaches stateoftheart model performance, which is impressive given that i those models access gold passages with specic information required to generate the reference answer , ii many questions are unanswerable without the gold passages, and iii not all questions are answerable from wikipedia alone. table 3 shows some generated answers from our models. qualitatively, we nd that rag models hallucinate less and generate factually correct text more often than bart. later, we also show that rag generations are more diverse than bart generations see 4.5. 4.3 jeopardy question generation table 2 shows that ragtoken performs better than ragsequence on jeopardy question generation, with both models outperforming bart on qbleu1. 4 shows human evaluation results, over 452 pairs of generations from bart and ragtoken. evaluators indicated that bart was more factual than rag in only 7.1 of cases, while rag was more factual in 42.7 of cases, and both rag and bart were factual in a further 17 of cases, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of rag on the task over a stateoftheart generation model. evaluators also nd rag generations to be more specic by a large margin. table 3 shows typical generations from each model. jeopardy questions often contain two separate pieces of information, and ragtoken may perform best because it can generate responses that combine content from several documents. figure 2 shows an example. when generating sun, the posterior is high for document 2 which mentions the sun also rises. similarly, document 1 dominates the posterior when a farewell to arms is generated. intriguingly, after the rst token of each book is generated, the document posterior attens. this observation suggests that the generator can complete the titles without depending on specic documents. in other words, the models parametric knowledge is sufcient to complete the titles. we nd evidence for this hypothesis by feeding the bartonly baseline with the partial decoding \"the sun. bart completes the generation \"the sun also rises\" is a novel by this author of \"the sun also rises\" indicating the title \"the sun also rises\" is stored in barts parameters. similarly, bart will complete the partial decoding \"the sun also rises\" is a novel by this author of \"a with \"the sun also rises\" is a novel by this author of \"a farewell to arms\". this example shows how parametric and nonparametric memories work togetherthe nonparametric component helps to guide the generation, drawing out specic knowledge stored in the parametric memory. 4.4 fact verication table 2 shows our results on fever. for 3way classication, rag scores are within 4.3 of stateoftheart models, which are complex pipeline systems with domainspecic architectures and substantial engineering, trained using intermediate retrieval supervision, which rag does not require. 6 document 1 his works are considered classics of american literature ... his wartime experiences

and vlachos 57, who train roberta 35 to classify the claim as true or false given the gold evidence sentence. rag achieves an accuracy within 2.7 of this model, despite being supplied with only the claim and retrieving its own evidence. we also analyze whether documents retrieved by rag correspond to documents annotated as gold evidence in fever. we calculate the overlap in article titles between the top k documents retrieved by rag and gold evidence annotations. we nd that the top retrieved document is from a gold article in 71 of cases, and a gold article is present in the top 10 retrieved articles in 90 of cases. 4.5 additional results generation diversity section 4.3 shows that rag models are more factual and specic than bart for jeopardy question generation. following recent work on diversitypromoting decoding 33, 59, 39, we also investigate generation diversity by calculating the ratio of distinct ngrams to total ngrams generated by different models. table 5 shows that ragsequences generations are more diverse than ragtokens, and both are signicantly more diverse than bart without needing any diversitypromoting decoding. retrieval ablations a key feature of rag is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task. to assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever during training. as shown in table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks. we compare rags dense retriever to a word overlapbased bm25 retriever 53. here, we replace rags retriever with a xed bm25 system, and use bm25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating pzx. table 6 shows the results. for fever, bm25 performs best, perhaps since fever claims are heavily entitycentric and thus wellsuited for word overlapbased retrieval. differentiable retrieval improves results on all other tasks, especially for opendomain qa, where it is crucial. index hotswapping an advantage of nonparametric memory models like rag is that knowledge can be easily updated at test time. parametriconly models like t5 or bart need further training to update their behavior as the world changes. to demonstrate, we build an index using the drqa 5 wikipedia dump from december 2016 and compare outputs from rag using this index to the newer index from our main results december 2018. we prepare a list of 82 world leaders who had changed 7 table 4 human assessments for the jeopardy question generation task. factuality specicity bart better 7.1 16.8 rag better 42.7 37.4 both good 11.7 11.8 both poor 17.7 6.9 no majority

indices is low 12 with the 2018 index and 2016 leaders, 4 with the 2016 index and 2018 leaders. this shows we can update rags world knowledge by simply replacing its nonparametric memory. effect of retrieving more documents models are trained with either 5 or 10 retrieved latent documents, and we do not observe signicant differences in performance between them. we have the exibility to adjust the number of retrieved documents at test time, which can affect performance and runtime. figure 3 left shows that retrieving more documents at test time monotonically improves opendomain qa results for ragsequence, but performance peaks for ragtoken at 10 retrieved documents. figure 3 right shows that retrieving more documents leads to higher rougel for ragtoken at the expense of bleu1, but the effect is less pronounced for ragsequence. 10 20 30 40 50 k retrieved docs 39 40 41 42 43 44 nq exact match ragtok ragseq 10 20 30 40 50 k retrieved docs 40 50 60 70 80 nq answer recall k ragtok

a variety of nlp tasks when considered in isolation. such tasks include opendomain question answering 5, 29, fact checking 56, fact completion 48, longform question answering 12, wikipedia article generation 36, dialogue 41, 65, 9, 13, translation 17, and language modeling 19, 27. our work unies previous successes in incorporating retrieval into individual tasks, showing that a single retrievalbased architecture is capable of achieving strong performance across several tasks. 8 generalpurpose architectures for nlp prior work on generalpurpose architectures for nlp tasks has shown great success without the use of retrieval. a single, pretrained language model has been shown to achieve strong performance on various classication tasks in the glue benchmarks 60, 61 after netuning 49, 8. gpt2 50 later showed that a single, lefttoright, pretrained language model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks. for further improvement, bart 32 and t5 51, 52 propose a single, pretrained encoderdecoder model that leverages bidirectional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative and generative tasks. our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, unied architecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pretrained, generative language models. learned retrieval there is signicant work on learning to retrieve documents in information retrieval, more recently with pretrained, neural language models 44, 26 similar to ours. some work optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a specic, downstream task such as question answering, using search 46, reinforcement learning 6, 63, 62, or a latent variable approach 31, 20 as in our work. these successes leverage different retrievalbased architectures and optimization techniques to achieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrievalbased architecture can be netuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks. memorybased architectures our document index can be seen as a large external memory for neural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks 64, 55. concurrent work 14 learns to retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our work. other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over fact embeddings 15, 13. a key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather distributed representations, which makes the memory both i humanreadable, lending a form of interpretability to our model, and ii humanwritable, enabling us to dynamically update the models memory by editing the document index. this approach has also been used in knowledgeintensive dialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via tfidf rather than endtoend learnt retrieval 9. retrieveandedit approaches our method shares some similarities with retrieveandedit style approaches, where a similar training inputoutput pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited to provide a nal output. these approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including machine translation 18, 22 and semantic parsing 21. our approach does have several differences, including less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content from several pieces of retrieved content, as well as learning latent retrieval, and retrieving evidence documents rather than related training pairs. this said, rag techniques may work well in these settings, and could represent promising future work. 6 discussion in this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and nonparametric memory. we showed that our rag models obtain state of the art results on opendomain qa. we found that people prefer rags generation over purely parametric bart, nding rag more factual and specic. we conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating its effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hotswapped to update the model without requiring any retraining. in future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components can be jointly pretrained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to bart or some another objective. our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and nonparametric memories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a wide variety of nlp tasks. 9 broader impact this work offers several positive societal benets over previous work the fact that it is more strongly grounded in real factual knowledge in this case wikipedia makes it hallucinate less with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. rag could be employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct benet to society, for example by endowing it with a medical index and asking it opendomain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more effective at their jobs. with these advantages also come potential downsides wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge source, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. since rag can be employed as a language model, similar concerns as for gpt2 50 are valid here, although arguably to a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in the news or on social media to impersonate others or to automate the production of spamphishing content 54. advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the coming decades 16. in order to mitigate these risks, ai systems could be employed to ght against misleading content and automated spamphishing. acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback on this paper, as well as huggingface for their help in

implementation details for opendomain qa we report test numbers using 15 retrieved documents for ragtoken models. for ragsequence models, we report test results using 50 retrieved documents, and we use the thorough decoding approach since answers are generally short. we use greedy decoding for qa as we did not nd beam search improved results. for openmsmarco and jeopardy question generation, we report test numbers using ten retrieved documents for both ragtoken and ragsequence, and we also train a bartlarge model as a baseline. we use a beam size of four, and use the fast decoding approach for ragsequence models, as thorough decoding did not improve performance. b human evaluation figure 4 annotation interface for human evaluation of factuality. a popout for detailed instructions and a worked example appear when clicking \"view tool guide\". figure 4 shows the user interface for human evaluation. to avoid any biases for screen position, which model corresponded to sentence a and sentence b was randomly selected for each example. annotators were encouraged to research the topic using the internet, and were given detailed instructions and worked examples in a full instructions tab. we included some gold sentences in order to assess the accuracy of the annotators. two annotators did not perform well on these examples and their annotations were removed from the results. c training setup details we train all rag models and bart baselines using fairseq 45.2 we train with mixed precision oating point arithmetic 40, distributing training across 8, 32gb nvidia v100 gpus, though training and inference can be run on one gpu. we nd that doing maximum inner product search with faiss is sufciently fast on cpu, so we store document index vectors on cpu, requiring 100 gb of cpu memory for all of wikipedia. after submission, we have ported our code to huggingface transformers 663, which achieves equivalent performance to the previous version but is a cleaner and easier to use implementation. this version is also opensourced. we also compress the document index using faisss compression tools, reducing the cpu memory requirement to 36gb. scripts to run experiments with rag can be found at httpsgithub.comhuggingfacetransformers blobmasterexamplesragreadme.md and an interactive demo of a rag model can be found at httpshuggingface.corag 2httpsgithub.compytorchfairseq 3httpsgithub.comhuggingfacetransformers 17 d further details on opendomain qa for opendomain qa, multiple answer annotations are often available for a given question. these answer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer annotations are used to nd matches within documents when preparing training data. for rag, we also make use of multiple annotation examples for natural questions and webquestions by training the model with each q, a pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. for triviaqa, there are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets, such as emoji or spelling variants. for triviaqa, we lter out answer candidates if they do not occur in top 1000 documents for the query. curatedtrec preprocessing the answers for curatedtrec are given in the form of regular expressions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answergeneration models 20. to overcome this, we use a preprocessing step where we rst retrieve the top 1000 documents for each query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision target. if no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic generate all possible permutations for each regex, replacing nondeterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace. triviaqa evaluation setups the opendomain qa community customarily uses public development datasets as test datasets, as test data for qa datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading compehension purposes. we report our results using the datasets splits used in dpr 26, which are consistent with common practice in opendomain qa. for triviaqa, this test dataset is the public triviaqa web development split. roberts et al. 52 used the triviaqa ofcial wikipedia test set instead. fvry et al. 14 follow this convention in order to compare with roberts et al. 52 see appendix of 14. we report results on both test sets to enable fair comparison to both approaches. we nd that our performance is much higher using the ofcial wiki test set, rather than the more conventional opendomain test set, which we attribute to the ofcial wiki test set questions being simpler to answer from wikipedia. e further details on fever for fever classication, we follow the practice from 32, and rst regenerate the claim, and then classify using the representation of the nal hidden state, before nally marginalizing across documents to obtain the class probabilities. the fever task traditionally has two subtasks. the rst is to classify the claim as either \"supported\", \"refuted\" or \"not enough info\", which is the task we explore in the main paper. fevers other subtask involves extracting sentences from wikipedia as evidence supporting the classication prediction. as fever uses a different wikipedia dump to us, directly tackling this task is not straightforward. we hope to address this in future work. f null document probabilities we experimented with adding \"null document\" mechanism to rag, similar to realm 20 in order to model cases where no useful information could be retrieved for a given input. here, if k documents were retrieved, we would additionally \"retrieve\" an empty document and predict a logit for the null document, before marginalizing over k 1 predictions. we explored modelling this null document logit by learning i a document embedding for the null document, ii a static learnt bias term, or iii a neural network to predict the logit. we did not nd that these improved performance, so in the interests of simplicity, we omit them. for open msmarco, where useful retrieved documents cannot always be retrieved, we observe that the model learns to always retrieve a particular set of documents for questions that are less likely to benet from retrieval, suggesting that null document mechanisms may not be necessary for rag. g parameters our rag models contain the trainable parameters for the bertbase query and document encoder of dpr, with 110m parameters each although we do not train the document encoder ourselves and 406m trainable parameters from bartlarge, 406m parameters, making a total of 626m trainable 18 table 7 number of instances in the datasets used. a hidden subset of this data is used for

parameters. the t5 model with the closest number of parameters to our models is t5large 770m parameters, which achieves a score of 28.9 em on natural questions 52, substantially below the 44.5 that ragsequence achieves, indicating that hybrid parametricnonparametric models require far fewer trainable parameters for strong opendomain qa performance. the nonparametric memory index does not consist of trainable parameters, but does consists of 21m 728 dimensional vectors, consisting of 15.3b values. these can be easily be stored at 8bit oating point precision to manage memory and disk footprints. h retrieval collapse in preliminary experiments, we observed that for some tasks such as story generation 11, the retrieval component would collapse and learn to retrieve the same documents regardless of the input. in these cases, once retrieval had collapsed, the generator would learn to ignore the documents, and the rag model would perform equivalently to bart. the collapse could be due to a lessexplicit requirement for factual knowledge in some tasks, or the longer target sequences, which could result in less informative gradients for the retriever. perez et al. 46 also found spurious retrieval results when optimizing a retrieval component in order to improve performance on downstream tasks. i number of instances per dataset the number of training, development and

remain open research problems.\\n\\npretrained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit nonparametric memory have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks.\\n\\nwe explore a generalpurpose netuning recipe for retrievalaugmented generation rag models which combine pretrained parametric and nonparametric memory for language generation.\\n\\nwe introduce rag models where the parametric memory is a pretrained seq2seq model and the nonparametric memory is a dense vector index of wikipedia, accessed with a pretrained neural retriever.\\n\\nwe compare two rag formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, and another which can use different passages per token.\\n\\nwe netune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledgeintensive nlp tasks and set the state of the art on three open domain qa tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and taskspecic retrieveandextract architectures.\\n\\nfor language generation tasks, we nd that rag models generate more specic, diverse and factual language than a stateoftheart parametriconly seq2seq baseline.\\n\\n1 introduction pretrained neural language models have been shown to learn a substantial amount of indepth knowledge from data 47. they can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized implicit knowledge base 51, 52. while this development is exciting, such models do have downsides they cannot easily expand or revise their memory, cant straightforwardly provide insight into their predictions, and may produce hallucinations 38. hybrid models that combine parametric memory with nonparametric i.e., retrievalbased memories 20, 26, 48 can address some of these issues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be inspected and interpreted.\\n\\nrealm 20 and orqa 31, two recently introduced models that combine

we bring hybrid parametric and nonparametric memory to the workhorse of nlp, i.e.\\n\\nsequencetosequence seq2seq models.\\n\\nwe endow pretrained, parametricmemory generation models with a nonparametric memory through a generalpurpose netuning approach which we refer to as retrievalaugmented generation rag.\\n\\nwe build rag models where the parametric memory is a pretrained seq2seq transformer, and the nonparametric memory is a dense vector index of wikipedia, accessed with a pretrained neural retriever.\\n\\nwe combine these components in a probabilistic model trained endtoend fig.\\n\\n1. the retriever dense passage retriever 26, henceforth dpr provides latent documents conditioned on the input, and the seq2seq model bart 32 then conditions on these latent documents together with the input to generate the output.\\n\\nwe marginalize the latent documents with a topk approximation, either on a peroutput basis assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens or a pertoken basis where different documents are responsible for different tokens.\\n\\nlike t5 51 or bart, rag can be netuned on any seq2seq task, whereby both the generator and retriever are jointly learned.\\n\\nthere has been extensive previous work proposing architectures to enrich systems with nonparametric memory which are trained from scratch for specic tasks, e.g.\\n\\nmemory networks 64, 55, stackaugmented networks 25 and memory layers 30. in contrast, we explore a setting where both parametric and nonparametric memory components are pretrained and preloaded with extensive knowledge.\\n\\ncrucially, by using pretrained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is present without additional training.\\n\\nour results highlight the benets of combining parametric and nonparametric memory with generation for knowledgeintensive taskstasks that humans could not reasonably be expected to perform without access to an external knowledge source.\\n\\nour rag models achieve stateoftheart results on open natural questions 29, webquestions 3 and curatedtrec 2 and strongly outperform recent approaches that use specialised pretraining objectives on triviaqa 24. despite these being extractive tasks, we nd that unconstrained generation outperforms previous extractive approaches.\\n\\nfor knowledgeintensive generation, we experiment with msmarco 1 and jeopardy question generation, and we nd that our models generate responses that are more factual, specic, and diverse than a bart baseline.\\n\\nfor fever 56 fact verication, we achieve results within 4.3 of stateoftheart pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision.\\n\\nfinally, we demonstrate that the nonparametric memory can be replaced to update the models knowledge as the world changes.1 2 methods we explore rag models, which use the input sequence x to retrieve text documents z and use them as additional context when generating the target sequence y. as shown in figure 1, our models leverage two components i a retriever pzx with parameters that returns topk truncated distributions over text passages given a query x and ii a generator pyix, z, y1i1 parametrized 1code to run experiments with rag has been opensourced as part of the huggingface transformers library 66 and can be found at httpsgithub.comhuggingfacetransformersblobmaster examplesrag.\\n\\nan interactive demo of rag models can be found at httpshuggingface.corag 2 by that generates a current token based on a context of the previous i 1 tokens y1i1, the original input x and a retrieved passage z. to train the retriever and generator endtoend, we treat the retrieved document as a latent variable.\\n\\nwe propose two models that marginalize over the latent documents in different ways to produce a distribution over generated text.\\n\\nin one approach, ragsequence, the model uses the same document to predict each target token.\\n\\nthe second approach, ragtoken, can predict each target token based on a different document.', 'in one approach, ragsequence, the model uses the same document to predict each target token.\\n\\nthe second approach, ragtoken, can predict each target token based on a different document.\\n\\nin the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the p and p components, as well as the training and decoding procedure.\\n\\n2.1 models ragsequence model the ragsequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate the complete sequence.\\n\\ntechnically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that is marginalized to get the seq2seq probability pyx via a topk approximation.\\n\\nconcretely, the top k documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence probability for each document, which are then marginalized, pragsequenceyx x ztopkpx pzxpyx, z x ztopkpx pzx n y i pyix, z, y1i1 ragtoken model in the ragtoken model we can draw a different latent document for each target token and marginalize accordingly.\\n\\nthis allows the generator to choose content from several documents when producing an answer.\\n\\nconcretely, the top k documents are retrieved using the retriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document, before marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, formally, we dene pragtokenyx n y i x ztopkpx pzxpyix, z, y1i1 finally, we note that rag can be used for sequence classication tasks by considering the target class as a target sequence of length one, in which case ragsequence and ragtoken are equivalent.\\n\\n2.2 retriever dpr the retrieval component pzx is based on dpr 26. dpr follows a biencoder architecture pzx exp dzqx dz bertdz, qx bertqx where dz is a dense representation of a document produced by a bertbase document encoder 8, and qx a query representation produced by a query encoder, also based on bertbase.\\n\\ncalculating topkpx, the list of k documents z with highest prior probability pzx, is a maximum inner product search mips problem, which can be approximately solved in sublinear time 23. we use a pretrained biencoder from dpr to initialize our retriever and to build the document index.\\n\\nthis retriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to triviaqa 24 questions and natural questions 29. we refer to the document index as the nonparametric memory.\\n\\n2.3 generator bart the generator component pyix, z, y1i1 could be modelled using any encoderdecoder.\\n\\nwe use bartlarge 32, a pretrained seq2seq transformer 58 with 400m parameters.\\n\\nto combine the input x with the retrieved content z when generating from bart, we simply concatenate them.\\n\\nbart was pretrained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions.\\n\\nit has obtained stateoftheart results on a diverse set of generation tasks and outperforms comparablysized t5 models 32. we refer to the bart generator parameters as the parametric memory henceforth.\\n\\n2.4 training we jointly train the retriever and generator components without any direct supervision on what document should be retrieved.\\n\\ngiven a netuning training corpus of inputoutput pairs xj, yj, we 3 minimize the negative marginal loglikelihood of each target, p j log pyjxj using stochastic gradient descent with adam 28. updating the document encoder bertd during training is costly as it requires the document index to be periodically updated as realm does during pretraining 20. we do not nd this step necessary for strong performance, and keep the document encoder and index xed, only netuning the query encoder bertq and the bart generator.\\n\\n2.5 decoding at test time, ragsequence and ragtoken require different ways to approximate arg maxy pyx.\\n\\nragtoken the ragtoken model can be seen as a standard, autoregressive seq2seq generator with transition probability p yix, y1i1 p ztopkpx pzixpyix, zi, y1i1 to decode, we can plug p yix, y1i1 into a standard beam decoder.', 'ragsequence for ragsequence, the likelihood pyx does not break into a conventional pertoken likelihood, hence we cannot solve it with a single beam search.\\n\\ninstead, we run beam search for each document z, scoring each hypothesis using pyix, z, y1i1.\\n\\nthis yields a set of hypotheses y , some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents.\\n\\nto estimate the probability of an hypothesis y we run an additional forward pass for each document z for which y does not appear in the beam, multiply generator probability with pzx and then sum the probabilities across beams for the marginals.\\n\\nwe refer to this decoding procedure as thorough decoding.\\n\\nfor longer output sequences, y can become large, requiring many forward passes.\\n\\nfor more efcient decoding, we can make a further approximation that pyx, zi 0 where y was not generated during beam search from x, zi.\\n\\nthis avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set y has been generated.\\n\\nwe refer to this decoding procedure as fast decoding.\\n\\n3 experiments we experiment with rag in a wide range of knowledgeintensive tasks.\\n\\nfor all experiments, we use a single wikipedia dump for our nonparametric knowledge source.\\n\\nfollowing lee et al.\\n\\n31 and karpukhin et al.\\n\\n26, we use the december 2018 dump.\\n\\neach wikipedia article is split into disjoint 100word chunks, to make a total of 21m documents.\\n\\nwe use the document encoder to compute an embedding for each document, and build a single mips index using faiss 23 with a hierarchical navigable small world approximation for fast retrieval 37. during training, we retrieve the top k documents for each query.\\n\\nwe consider k 5, 10 for training and set k for test time using dev data.\\n\\nwe now discuss experimental details for each task.\\n\\n3.1 opendomain question answering opendomain question answering qa is an important realworld application and common testbed for knowledgeintensive tasks 20. we treat questions and answers as inputoutput text pairs x, y and train rag by directly minimizing the negative loglikelihood of answers.\\n\\nwe compare rag to the popular extractive qa paradigm 5, 7, 31, 26, where answers are extracted spans from retrieved documents, relying primarily on nonparametric knowledge.\\n\\nwe also compare to closedbook qa approaches 52, which, like rag, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead relying purely on parametric knowledge.\\n\\nwe consider four popular opendomain qa datasets natural questions nq 29, triviaqa tqa 24. webquestions wq 3 and curatedtrec ct 2. as ct and wq are small, we follow dpr 26 by initializing ct and wq models with our nq rag model.\\n\\nwe use the same traindevtest splits as prior work 31, 26 and report exact match em scores.\\n\\nfor tqa, to compare with t5 52, we also evaluate on the tqa wiki test set.\\n\\n3.2 abstractive question answering rag models can go beyond simple extractive qa and answer questions with freeform, abstractive text generation.\\n\\nto test rags natural language generation nlg in a knowledgeintensive setting, we use the msmarco nlg task v2.1 43. the task consists of questions, ten gold passages retrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the retrieved passages.\\n\\nwe do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat 4 msmarco as an opendomain abstractive qa task.\\n\\nmsmarco has some questions that cannot be answered in a way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as what is the weather in volcano, ca?\\n\\nso performance will be lower without using gold passages.\\n\\nwe also note that some msmarco questions cannot be answered using wikipedia alone.\\n\\nhere, rag can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses.\\n\\n3.3 jeopardy question generation to evaluate rags generation abilities in a nonqa setting, we study opendomain question generation.', '3.3 jeopardy question generation to evaluate rags generation abilities in a nonqa setting, we study opendomain question generation.\\n\\nrather than use questions from standard opendomain qa tasks, which typically consist of short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating jeopardy questions.\\n\\njeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity.\\n\\nfor example, the world cup is the answer to the question in 1986 mexico scored as the rst country to host this international sports competition twice.\\n\\nas jeopardy questions are precise, factual statements, generating jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a challenging knowledgeintensive generation task.\\n\\nwe use the splits from searchqa 10, with 100k train, 14k dev, and 27k test examples.\\n\\nas this is a new task, we train a bart model for comparison.\\n\\nfollowing 67, we evaluate using the squadtuned qbleu1 metric 42. qbleu is a variant of bleu with a higher weight for matching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than standard metrics.\\n\\nwe also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and one for specicity.\\n\\nwe dene factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external sources, and specicity as high mutual dependence between the input and output 33. we follow best practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation 34. evaluators are shown an answer and two generated questions, one from bart and one from rag.\\n\\nthey are then asked to pick one of four optionsquuestion a is better, question b is better, both are good, or neither is good.\\n\\n3.4 fact verication fever 56 requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by wikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide.\\n\\nthe task requires retrieving evidence from wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify whether the claim is true, false, or unveriable from wikipedia alone.\\n\\nfever is a retrieval problem coupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task.\\n\\nit also provides an appropriate testbed for exploring the rag models ability to handle classication rather than generation.\\n\\nwe map fever class labels supports, refutes, or not enough info to single output tokens and directly train with claimclass pairs.\\n\\ncrucially, unlike most other approaches to fever, we do not use supervision on retrieved evidence.\\n\\nin many realworld applications, retrieval supervision signals arent available, and models that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks.\\n\\nwe explore two variants the standard 3way classication task supportsrefutesnot enough info and the 2way supportsrefutes task studied in thorne and vlachos 57. in both cases we report label accuracy.\\n\\n4 results 4.1 opendomain question answering table 1

exibility of the closedbook parametric only approaches and the performance of \"openbook\" retrievalbased approaches.\\n\\nunlike realm and t5ssm, rag enjoys strong results without expensive, specialized salient span masking pretraining 20. it is worth noting that rags retriever is initialized using dprs retriever, which uses retrieval supervision on natural questions and triviaqa.\\n\\nrag compares favourably to the dpr qa system, which uses a bertbased crossencoder to rerank documents, along with an extractive reader.\\n\\nrag demonstrates that neither a reranker nor

retrieval prior work has shown that retrieval improves performance across a variety of nlp tasks when considered in isolation.\\n\\nsuch tasks include opendomain question answering 5, 29, fact checking 56, fact completion 48, longform question answering 12, wikipedia article generation 36, dialogue 41, 65, 9, 13, translation 17, and language modeling 19, 27. our work unies previous successes in incorporating retrieval into individual tasks, showing that a single retrievalbased architecture is capable of achieving strong performance across several tasks.\\n\\n8 generalpurpose architectures for nlp prior work on generalpurpose architectures for nlp tasks has shown great success without the use of retrieval.\\n\\na single, pretrained language model has been shown to achieve strong performance on various classication tasks in the glue benchmarks 60, 61 after netuning 49, 8. gpt2 50 later showed that a single, lefttoright, pretrained language model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks.\\n\\nfor further improvement, bart 32 and t5 51, 52 propose a single, pretrained encoderdecoder model that leverages bidirectional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative and generative tasks.\\n\\nour work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, unied architecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pretrained, generative language models.\\n\\nlearned retrieval there is signicant work on learning to retrieve documents in information retrieval, more recently with pretrained, neural language models 44, 26 similar to ours.\\n\\nsome work optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a specic, downstream task such as question answering, using search 46, reinforcement learning 6, 63, 62, or a latent variable approach 31, 20 as in our work.\\n\\nthese successes leverage different retrievalbased architectures and optimization techniques to achieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrievalbased architecture can be netuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks.\\n\\nmemorybased architectures our document index can be seen as a large external memory for neural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks 64, 55. concurrent work 14 learns to retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our work.\\n\\nother work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over fact embeddings 15, 13. a key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather distributed representations, which makes the memory both i humanreadable, lending a form of interpretability to our model, and ii humanwritable, enabling us to dynamically update the models memory by editing the document index.\\n\\nthis approach has also been used in knowledgeintensive dialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via tfidf rather than endtoend learnt retrieval 9. retrieveandedit approaches our method shares some similarities with retrieveandedit style approaches, where a similar training inputoutput pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited to provide a nal output.\\n\\nthese approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including machine translation 18, 22 and semantic parsing 21. our approach does have several differences, including less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content from several pieces of retrieved content, as well as learning latent retrieval, and retrieving evidence documents rather than related training pairs.\\n\\nthis said, rag techniques may work well in these settings, and could represent promising future work.\\n\\n6 discussion in this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and nonparametric memory.\\n\\nwe showed that our rag models obtain state of the art results on opendomain qa.', '6 discussion in this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and nonparametric memory.\\n\\nwe showed that our rag models obtain state of the art results on opendomain qa.\\n\\nwe found that people prefer rags generation over purely parametric bart, nding rag more factual and specic.\\n\\nwe conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating its effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hotswapped to update the model without requiring any retraining.\\n\\nin future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components can be jointly pretrained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to bart or some another objective.\\n\\nour work opens up new research directions on how parametric and nonparametric memories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a wide variety of nlp tasks.\\n\\n9 broader impact this work offers several positive societal benets over previous work the fact that it is more strongly grounded in real factual knowledge in this case wikipedia makes it hallucinate less with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability.\\n\\nrag could be employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct benet to society, for example by endowing it with a medical index and asking it opendomain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more effective at their jobs.\\n\\nwith these advantages also come potential downsides wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge source, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias.\\n\\nsince rag can be employed as a language model, similar concerns as for gpt2 50 are valid here, although arguably to a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in the news or on social media to impersonate others or to automate the production of spamphishing content 54. advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the coming decades 16. in order to mitigate these risks, ai systems could be employed to ght against misleading content and automated spamphishing.\\n\\nacknowledgments the authors would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback on this paper, as well as

available for a given question.\\n\\nthese answer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer annotations are used to nd matches within documents when preparing training data.\\n\\nfor rag, we also make use of multiple annotation examples for natural questions and webquestions by training the model with each q, a pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy.\\n\\nfor triviaqa, there are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets, such as emoji or spelling variants.\\n\\nfor triviaqa, we lter out answer candidates if they do not occur in top 1000 documents for the query.\\n\\ncuratedtrec preprocessing the answers for curatedtrec are given in the form of regular expressions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answergeneration models 20. to overcome this, we use a preprocessing step where we rst retrieve the top 1000 documents for each query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision target.\\n\\nif no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic generate all possible permutations for each regex, replacing nondeterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace.\\n\\ntriviaqa evaluation setups the opendomain qa community customarily uses public development datasets as test datasets, as test data for qa datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading compehension purposes.\\n\\nwe report our results using the datasets splits used in dpr 26, which are consistent with common practice in opendomain qa.\\n\\nfor triviaqa, this test dataset is the public triviaqa web development split.\\n\\nroberts et al.\\n\\n52 used the triviaqa ofcial wikipedia test

questions being simpler to answer from wikipedia.\\n\\ne further details on fever for fever classication, we follow the practice from 32, and rst regenerate the claim, and then classify using the representation of the nal hidden state, before nally marginalizing across documents to obtain the class probabilities.\\n\\nthe fever task traditionally has two subtasks.\\n\\nthe rst is to classify the claim as either \"supported\", \"refuted\" or \"not enough info\", which is the task we explore in the main paper.\\n\\nfevers other subtask involves extracting sentences from wikipedia as evidence supporting the classication prediction.\\n\\nas fever uses a different wikipedia dump to us, directly tackling this task is not straightforward.\\n\\nwe hope to address this in future work.\\n\\nf null document probabilities we experimented with adding \"null document\" mechanism to rag, similar to realm 20 in order to model cases where no useful information could be retrieved for a given input.', 'here, if k documents were retrieved, we would additionally \"retrieve\" an empty document and predict a logit for the null document, before marginalizing over k 1 predictions.\\n\\nwe explored modelling this null document logit by learning i a document embedding for the null document, ii a static learnt bias term, or iii a neural network to predict the logit.\\n\\nwe did not nd that these improved performance, so in the interests of simplicity, we omit them.\\n\\nfor open msmarco, where useful retrieved documents cannot always be retrieved, we observe that the model learns to always retrieve a particular set of documents for questions that are less likely to benet from retrieval, suggesting that null document mechanisms may not be necessary for rag.\\n\\ng parameters our rag models contain the trainable parameters for the bertbase query and document encoder of dpr, with 110m parameters each although we do not train the document encoder

       " 'but have only explored opendomain extractive question answering.  here, we bring hybrid parametric and nonparametric memory to the workhorse of nlp, i.e.  sequencetosequence seq2seq models.  we endow pretrained, parametricmemory generation models with a nonparametric memory through a generalpurpose netuning approach which we refer to as retrievalaugmented generation rag.  we build rag models where the parametric memory is a pretrained seq2seq transformer, and the nonparametric memory is a dense vector index of wikipedia, accessed with a pretrained neural retriever.  we combine these components in a probabilistic model trained endtoend fig.  1. the retriever dense passage retriever 26, henceforth dpr provides latent documents conditioned on the input, and the seq2seq model bart 32 then conditions on these latent documents together with the input to generate the output.  we marginalize the latent documents with a topk approximation, either on a peroutput basis assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens or a pertoken basis where different documents are responsible for different tokens.  like t5 51 or bart, rag can be netuned on any seq2seq task, whereby both the generator and retriever are jointly learned.  there has been extensive previous work proposing architectures to enrich systems with nonparametric memory which are trained from scratch for specic tasks, e.g.  memory networks 64, 55, stackaugmented networks 25 and memory layers 30. in contrast, we explore a setting where both parametric and nonparametric memory components are pretrained and preloaded with extensive knowledge.  crucially, by using pretrained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is present without additional training.  our results highlight the benets of combining parametric and nonparametric memory with generation for knowledgeintensive taskstasks that humans could not reasonably be expected to perform without access to an external knowledge source.  our rag models achieve stateoftheart results on open natural questions 29, webquestions 3 and curatedtrec 2 and strongly outperform recent approaches that use specialised pretraining objectives on triviaqa 24. despite these being extractive tasks, we nd that unconstrained generation outperforms previous extractive approaches.  for knowledgeintensive generation, we experiment with msmarco 1 and jeopardy question generation, and we nd that our models generate responses that are more factual, specic, and diverse than a bart baseline.  for fever 56 fact verication, we achieve results within 4.3 of stateoftheart pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision.  finally, we demonstrate that the nonparametric memory can be replaced to update the models knowledge as the world changes.1 2 methods we explore rag models, which use the input sequence x to retrieve text documents z and use them as additional context when generating the target sequence y. as shown in figure 1, our models leverage two components i a retriever pzx with parameters that returns topk truncated distributions over text passages given a query x and ii a generator pyix, z, y1i1 parametrized 1code to run experiments with rag has been opensourced as part of the huggingface transformers library 66 and can be found at httpsgithub.comhuggingfacetransformersblobmaster examplesrag.  an interactive demo of rag models can be found at httpshuggingface.corag 2 by that generates a current token based on a context of the previous i 1 tokens y1i1, the original input x and a retrieved passage z. to train the retriever and generator endtoend, we treat the retrieved document as a latent variable.  we propose two models that marginalize over the latent documents in different ways to produce a distribution over generated text.  in one approach, ragsequence, the model uses the same document to predict each target token.  the second approach, ragtoken, can predict each target token based on a different document.',\n",
       " 'in one approach, ragsequence, the model uses the same document to predict each target token.  the second approach, ragtoken, can predict each target token based on a different document.  in the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the p and p components, as well as the training and decoding procedure.  2.1 models ragsequence model the ragsequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate the complete sequence.  technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that is marginalized to get the seq2seq probability pyx via a topk approximation.  concretely, the top k documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence probability for each document, which are then marginalized, pragsequenceyx x ztopkpx pzxpyx, z x ztopkpx pzx n y i pyix, z, y1i1 ragtoken model in the ragtoken model we can draw a different latent document for each target token and marginalize accordingly.  this allows the generator to choose content from several documents when producing an answer.  concretely, the top k documents are retrieved using the retriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document, before marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, formally, we dene pragtokenyx n y i x ztopkpx pzxpyix, z, y1i1 finally, we note that rag can be used for sequence classication tasks by considering the target class as a target sequence of length one, in which case ragsequence and ragtoken are equivalent.  2.2 retriever dpr the retrieval component pzx is based on dpr 26. dpr follows a biencoder architecture pzx exp dzqx dz bertdz, qx bertqx where dz is a dense representation of a document produced by a bertbase document encoder 8, and qx a query representation produced by a query encoder, also based on bertbase.  calculating topkpx, the list of k documents z with highest prior probability pzx, is a maximum inner product search mips problem, which can be approximately solved in sublinear time 23. we use a pretrained biencoder from dpr to initialize our retriever and to build the document index.  this retriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to triviaqa 24 questions and natural questions 29. we refer to the document index as the nonparametric memory.  2.3 generator bart the generator component pyix, z, y1i1 could be modelled using any encoderdecoder.  we use bartlarge 32, a pretrained seq2seq transformer 58 with 400m parameters.  to combine the input x with the retrieved content z when generating from bart, we simply concatenate them.  bart was pretrained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions.  it has obtained stateoftheart results on a diverse set of generation tasks and outperforms comparablysized t5 models 32. we refer to the bart generator parameters as the parametric memory henceforth.  2.4 training we jointly train the retriever and generator components without any direct supervision on what document should be retrieved.  given a netuning training corpus of inputoutput pairs xj, yj, we 3 minimize the negative marginal loglikelihood of each target, p j log pyjxj using stochastic gradient descent with adam 28. updating the document encoder bertd during training is costly as it requires the document index to be periodically updated as realm does during pretraining 20. we do not nd this step necessary for strong performance, and keep the document encoder and index xed, only netuning the query encoder bertq and the bart generator.  2.5 decoding at test time, ragsequence and ragtoken require different ways to approximate arg maxy pyx.  ragtoken the ragtoken model can be seen as a standard, autoregressive seq2seq generator with transition probability p yix, y1i1 p ztopkpx pzixpyix, zi, y1i1 to decode, we can plug p yix, y1i1 into a standard beam decoder.',\n",
       " 'ragsequence for ragsequence, the likelihood pyx does not break into a conventional pertoken likelihood, hence we cannot solve it with a single beam search.  instead, we run beam search for each document z, scoring each hypothesis using pyix, z, y1i1.  this yields a set of hypotheses y , some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents.  to estimate the probability of an hypothesis y we run an additional forward pass for each document z for which y does not appear in the beam, multiply generator probability with pzx and then sum the probabilities across beams for the marginals.  we refer to this decoding procedure as thorough decoding.  for longer output sequences, y can become large, requiring many forward passes.  for more efcient decoding, we can make a further approximation that pyx, zi 0 where y was not generated during beam search from x, zi.  this avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set y has been generated.  we refer to this decoding procedure as fast decoding.  3 experiments we experiment with rag in a wide range of knowledgeintensive tasks.  for all experiments, we use a single wikipedia dump for our nonparametric knowledge source.  following lee et al.  31 and karpukhin et al.  26, we use the december 2018 dump.  each wikipedia article is split into disjoint 100word chunks, to make a total of 21m documents.  we use the document encoder to compute an embedding for each document, and build a single mips index using faiss 23 with a hierarchical navigable small world approximation for fast retrieval 37. during training, we retrieve the top k documents for each query.  we consider k 5, 10 for training and set k for test time using dev data.  we now discuss experimental details for each task.  3.1 opendomain question answering opendomain question answering qa is an important realworld application and common testbed for knowledgeintensive tasks 20. we treat questions and answers as inputoutput text pairs x, y and train rag by directly minimizing the negative loglikelihood of answers.  we compare rag to the popular extractive qa paradigm 5, 7, 31, 26, where answers are extracted spans from retrieved documents, relying primarily on nonparametric knowledge.  we also compare to closedbook qa approaches 52, which, like rag, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead relying purely on parametric knowledge.  we consider four popular opendomain qa datasets natural questions nq 29, triviaqa tqa 24. webquestions wq 3 and curatedtrec ct 2. as ct and wq are small, we follow dpr 26 by initializing ct and wq models with our nq rag model.  we use the same traindevtest splits as prior work 31, 26 and report exact match em scores.  for tqa, to compare with t5 52, we also evaluate on the tqa wiki test set.  3.2 abstractive question answering rag models can go beyond simple extractive qa and answer questions with freeform, abstractive text generation.  to test rags natural language generation nlg in a knowledgeintensive setting, we use the msmarco nlg task v2.1 43. the task consists of questions, ten gold passages retrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the retrieved passages.  we do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat 4 msmarco as an opendomain abstractive qa task.  msmarco has some questions that cannot be answered in a way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as what is the weather in volcano, ca?  so performance will be lower without using gold passages.  we also note that some msmarco questions cannot be answered using wikipedia alone.  here, rag can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses.  3.3 jeopardy question generation to evaluate rags generation abilities in a nonqa setting, we study opendomain question generation.',\n",
       " '3.3 jeopardy question generation to evaluate rags generation abilities in a nonqa setting, we study opendomain question generation.  rather than use questions from standard opendomain qa tasks, which typically consist of short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating jeopardy questions.  jeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity.  for example, the world cup is the answer to the question in 1986 mexico scored as the rst country to host this international sports competition twice.  as jeopardy questions are precise, factual statements, generating jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a challenging knowledgeintensive generation task.  we use the splits from searchqa 10, with 100k train, 14k dev, and 27k test examples.  as this is a new task, we train a bart model for comparison.  following 67, we evaluate using the squadtuned qbleu1 metric 42. qbleu is a variant of bleu with a higher weight for matching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than standard metrics.  we also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and one for specicity.  we dene factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external sources, and specicity as high mutual dependence between the input and output 33. we follow best practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation 34. evaluators are shown an answer and two generated questions, one from bart and one from rag.  they are then asked to pick one of four optionsquuestion a is better, question b is better, both are good, or neither is good.  3.4 fact verication fever 56 requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by wikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide.  the task requires retrieving evidence from wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify whether the claim is true, false, or unveriable from wikipedia alone.  fever is a retrieval problem coupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task.  it also provides an appropriate testbed for exploring the rag models ability to handle classication rather than generation.  we map fever class labels supports, refutes, or not enough info to single output tokens and directly train with claimclass pairs.  crucially, unlike most other approaches to fever, we do not use supervision on retrieved evidence.  in many realworld applications, retrieval supervision signals arent available, and models that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks.  we explore two variants the standard 3way classication task supportsrefutesnot enough info and the 2way supportsrefutes task studied in thorne and vlachos 57. in both cases we report label accuracy.  4 results 4.1 opendomain question answering table 1 shows results for rag along with stateoftheart models.  on all four opendomain qa tasks, rag sets a new state of the art only on the t5comparable split for tqa.  rag combines the generation exibility of the closedbook parametric only approaches and the performance of \"openbook\" retrievalbased approaches.  unlike realm and t5ssm, rag enjoys strong results without expensive, specialized salient span masking pretraining 20. it is worth noting that rags retriever is initialized using dprs retriever, which uses retrieval supervision on natural questions and triviaqa.  rag compares favourably to the dpr qa system, which uses a bertbased crossencoder to rerank documents, along with an extractive reader.  rag demonstrates that neither a reranker nor extractive reader is necessary for stateoftheart performance.  there are several advantages to generating answers even when it is possible to extract them.',\n",
       " 'rag demonstrates that neither a reranker nor extractive reader is necessary for stateoftheart performance.  there are several advantages to generating answers even when it is possible to extract them.  documents with clues about the answer but do not contain the answer verbatim can still contribute towards a correct answer being generated, which is not possible with standard extractive approaches, leading 5 table 1 opendomain qa test scores.  for tqa, left column uses the standard test set for opendomain qa, right column uses the tqawiki test set.  see appendix d for further details.  model nq tqa wq ct closed book t511b 52 34.5 50.1 37.4 t511bssm52 36.6 60.5 44.7 open book realm 20 40.4 40.7 46.8 dpr 26 41.5 57.9 41.1 50.6 ragtoken 44.1 55.266.1 45.5 50.0 ragseq.  44.5 56.868.0 45.2 52.2 table 2 generation and classication test scores.  msmarco sota is 4, fever3 is 68 and fever2 is 57 uses gold contextevidence.  best model without gold access underlined.  model jeopardy msmarco fvr3 fvr2 b1 qb1 rl b1 label acc.  sota 49.8 49.9 76.8 92.2 bart 15.1 19.7 38.2 41.6 64.0 81.1 ragtok.  17.3 22.2 40.1 41.5 72.5 89.5 ragseq.  14.7 21.4 40.8 44.2 to more effective marginalization over documents.  furthermore, rag can generate correct answers even when the correct answer is not in any retrieved document, achieving 11.8 accuracy in such cases for nq, where an extractive model would score 0.  4.2 abstractive question answering as shown in table 2, ragsequence outperforms bart on open msmarco nlg by 2.6 bleu points and 2.6 rougel points.  rag approaches stateoftheart model performance, which is impressive given that i those models access gold passages with specic information required to generate the reference answer , ii many questions are unanswerable without the gold passages, and iii not all questions are answerable from wikipedia alone.  table 3 shows some generated answers from our models.  qualitatively, we nd that rag models hallucinate less and generate factually correct text more often than bart.  later, we also show that rag generations are more diverse than bart generations see 4.5.  4.3 jeopardy question generation table 2 shows that ragtoken performs better than ragsequence on jeopardy question generation, with both models outperforming bart on qbleu1.  4 shows human evaluation results, over 452 pairs of generations from bart and ragtoken.  evaluators indicated that bart was more factual than rag in only 7.1 of cases, while rag was more factual in 42.7 of cases, and both rag and bart were factual in a further 17 of cases, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of rag on the task over a stateoftheart generation model.  evaluators also nd rag generations to be more specic by a large margin.  table 3 shows typical generations from each model.  jeopardy questions often contain two separate pieces of information, and ragtoken may perform best because it can generate responses that combine content from several documents.  figure 2 shows an example.  when generating sun, the posterior is high for document 2 which mentions the sun also rises.  similarly, document 1 dominates the posterior when a farewell to arms is generated.  intriguingly, after the rst token of each book is generated, the document posterior attens.  this observation suggests that the generator can complete the titles without depending on specic documents.  in other words, the models parametric knowledge is sufcient to complete the titles.  we nd evidence for this hypothesis by feeding the bartonly baseline with the partial decoding \"the sun.  bart completes the generation \"the sun also rises\" is a novel by this author of \"the sun also rises\" indicating the title \"the sun also rises\" is stored in barts parameters.  similarly, bart will complete the partial decoding \"the sun also rises\" is a novel by this author of \"a with \"the sun also rises\" is a novel by this author of \"a farewell to arms\".',\n",
       " 'similarly, bart will complete the partial decoding \"the sun also rises\" is a novel by this author of \"a with \"the sun also rises\" is a novel by this author of \"a farewell to arms\".  this example shows how parametric and nonparametric memories work togetherthe nonparametric component helps to guide the generation, drawing out specic knowledge stored in the parametric memory.  4.4 fact verication table 2 shows our results on fever.  for 3way classication, rag scores are within 4.3 of stateoftheart models, which are complex pipeline systems with domainspecic architectures and substantial engineering, trained using intermediate retrieval supervision, which rag does not require.  6 document 1 his works are considered classics of american literature ... his wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel a farewell to arms 1929 ... document 2 ... artists of the 1920s lost generation expatriate community.  his debut novel, the sun also rises, was published in 1926. bos the sun also r ises is a novel by this authorof a fare well to arms doc 1 doc 2 doc 3 doc 4 doc 5 figure 2 ragtoken document posterior pzix, yi, yi for each generated token for input hemingway\" for jeopardy generation with 5 retrieved documents.  the posterior for document 1 is high when generating a farewell to arms\" and for document 2 when generating the sun also rises\".  table 3 examples from generation tasks.  rag models generate more specic and factually accurate responses.  ?  indicates factually incorrect responses, indicates partially correct responses.  task input model generation msmarco dene middle ear bart ?the middle ear is the part of the ear between the middle ear and the nose.  ragt the middle ear is the portion of the ear internal to the eardrum.  rags the middle ear includes the tympanic cavity and the three ossicles.  what currency needed in scotland bart the currency needed in scotland is pound sterling.  ragt pound is the currency needed in scotland.  rags the currency needed in scotland is the pound sterling.  jeopardy question gener ation washington bart ?this state has the largest number of counties in the u.s. ragt its the only u.s. state named for a u.s. president rags its the state where youll nd mount rainier national park the divine comedy bart this epic poem by dante is divided into 3 parts the inferno, the purgatorio the purgatorio ragt dantes \"inferno\" is the rst part of this epic poem rags this 14th century work is divided into 3 sections \"inferno\", \"purgatorio\" \"paradiso\" for 2way classication, we compare against thorne and vlachos 57, who train roberta 35 to classify the claim as true or false given the gold evidence sentence.  rag achieves an accuracy within 2.7 of this model, despite being supplied with only the claim and retrieving its own evidence.  we also analyze whether documents retrieved by rag correspond to documents annotated as gold evidence in fever.  we calculate the overlap in article titles between the top k documents retrieved by rag and gold evidence annotations.  we nd that the top retrieved document is from a gold article in 71 of cases, and a gold article is present in the top 10 retrieved articles in 90 of cases.  4.5 additional results generation diversity section 4.3 shows that rag models are more factual and specic than bart for jeopardy question generation.  following recent work on diversitypromoting decoding 33, 59, 39, we also investigate generation diversity by calculating the ratio of distinct ngrams to total ngrams generated by different models.  table 5 shows that ragsequences generations are more diverse than ragtokens, and both are signicantly more diverse than bart without needing any diversitypromoting decoding.  retrieval ablations a key feature of rag is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task.  to assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever during training.',\n",
       " 'to assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever during training.  as shown in table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks.  we compare rags dense retriever to a word overlapbased bm25 retriever 53. here, we replace rags retriever with a xed bm25 system, and use bm25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating pzx.  table 6 shows the results.  for fever, bm25 performs best, perhaps since fever claims are heavily entitycentric and thus wellsuited for word overlapbased retrieval.  differentiable retrieval improves results on all other tasks, especially for opendomain qa, where it is crucial.  index hotswapping an advantage of nonparametric memory models like rag is that knowledge can be easily updated at test time.  parametriconly models like t5 or bart need further training to update their behavior as the world changes.  to demonstrate, we build an index using the drqa 5 wikipedia dump from december 2016 and compare outputs from rag using this index to the newer index from our main results december 2018. we prepare a list of 82 world leaders who had changed 7 table 4 human assessments for the jeopardy question generation task.  factuality specicity bart better 7.1 16.8 rag better 42.7 37.4 both good 11.7 11.8 both poor 17.7 6.9 no majority 20.8 20.1 table 5 ratio of distinct to total trigrams for generation tasks.  msmarco jeopardy qgen gold 89.6 90.0 bart 70.7 32.4 ragtoken 77.8 46.8 ragseq.  83.5 53.8 table 6 ablations on the dev set.  as fever is a classication task, both rag models are equivalent.  model nq tqa wq ct jeopardyqgen msmarco fvr3 fvr2 exact match b1 qb1 rl b1 label accuracy ragtokenbm25 29.7 41.5 32.1 33.1 17.5 22.3 55.5 48.4 75.1 91.6 ragsequencebm25 31.8 44.1 36.6 33.8 11.1 19.5 56.5 46.9 ragtokenfrozen 37.8 50.1 37.1 51.1 16.7 21.7 55.9 49.4 72.9 89.4 ragsequencefrozen 41.2 52.1 41.8 52.6 11.8 19.6 56.7 47.3 ragtoken 43.5 54.8 46.5 51.9 17.9 22.6 56.2 49.4 74.5 90.6 ragsequence 44.0 55.8 44.9 53.4 15.3 21.5 57.2 47.5 between these dates and use a template who is position?  e.g.  who is the president of peru?  to query our nq rag model with each index.  rag answers 70 correctly using the 2016 index for 2016 world leaders and 68 using the 2018 index for 2018 world leaders.  accuracy with mismatched indices is low 12 with the 2018 index and 2016 leaders, 4 with the 2016 index and 2018 leaders.  this shows we can update rags world knowledge by simply replacing its nonparametric memory.  effect of retrieving more documents models are trained with either 5 or 10 retrieved latent documents, and we do not observe signicant differences in performance between them.  we have the exibility to adjust the number of retrieved documents at test time, which can affect performance and runtime.  figure 3 left shows that retrieving more documents at test time monotonically improves opendomain qa results for ragsequence, but performance peaks for ragtoken at 10 retrieved documents.  figure 3 right shows that retrieving more documents leads to higher rougel for ragtoken at the expense of bleu1, but the effect is less pronounced for ragsequence.  10 20 30 40 50 k retrieved docs 39 40 41 42 43 44 nq exact match ragtok ragseq 10 20 30 40 50 k retrieved docs 40 50 60 70 80 nq answer recall k ragtok ragseq fixed dpr bm25 10 20 30 40 50 k retrieved docs 48 50 52 54 56 bleu1 rougel score ragtok rl ragtok b1 ragseq rl ragseq b1 figure 3 left nq performance as more documents are retrieved.  center retrieval recall performance in nq.  right msmarco bleu1 and rougel as more documents are retrieved.  5 related work singletask retrieval prior work has shown that retrieval improves performance across a variety of nlp tasks when considered in isolation.',\n",
       " '5 related work singletask retrieval prior work has shown that retrieval improves performance across a variety of nlp tasks when considered in isolation.  such tasks include opendomain question answering 5, 29, fact checking 56, fact completion 48, longform question answering 12, wikipedia article generation 36, dialogue 41, 65, 9, 13, translation 17, and language modeling 19, 27. our work unies previous successes in incorporating retrieval into individual tasks, showing that a single retrievalbased architecture is capable of achieving strong performance across several tasks.  8 generalpurpose architectures for nlp prior work on generalpurpose architectures for nlp tasks has shown great success without the use of retrieval.  a single, pretrained language model has been shown to achieve strong performance on various classication tasks in the glue benchmarks 60, 61 after netuning 49, 8. gpt2 50 later showed that a single, lefttoright, pretrained language model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks.  for further improvement, bart 32 and t5 51, 52 propose a single, pretrained encoderdecoder model that leverages bidirectional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative and generative tasks.  our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, unied architecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pretrained, generative language models.  learned retrieval there is signicant work on learning to retrieve documents in information retrieval, more recently with pretrained, neural language models 44, 26 similar to ours.  some work optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a specic, downstream task such as question answering, using search 46, reinforcement learning 6, 63, 62, or a latent variable approach 31, 20 as in our work.  these successes leverage different retrievalbased architectures and optimization techniques to achieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrievalbased architecture can be netuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks.  memorybased architectures our document index can be seen as a large external memory for neural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks 64, 55. concurrent work 14 learns to retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our work.  other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over fact embeddings 15, 13. a key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather distributed representations, which makes the memory both i humanreadable, lending a form of interpretability to our model, and ii humanwritable, enabling us to dynamically update the models memory by editing the document index.  this approach has also been used in knowledgeintensive dialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via tfidf rather than endtoend learnt retrieval 9. retrieveandedit approaches our method shares some similarities with retrieveandedit style approaches, where a similar training inputoutput pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited to provide a nal output.  these approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including machine translation 18, 22 and semantic parsing 21. our approach does have several differences, including less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content from several pieces of retrieved content, as well as learning latent retrieval, and retrieving evidence documents rather than related training pairs.  this said, rag techniques may work well in these settings, and could represent promising future work.  6 discussion in this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and nonparametric memory.  we showed that our rag models obtain state of the art results on opendomain qa.',\n",
       " '6 discussion in this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and nonparametric memory.  we showed that our rag models obtain state of the art results on opendomain qa.  we found that people prefer rags generation over purely parametric bart, nding rag more factual and specic.  we conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating its effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hotswapped to update the model without requiring any retraining.  in future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components can be jointly pretrained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to bart or some another objective.  our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and nonparametric memories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a wide variety of nlp tasks.  9 broader impact this work offers several positive societal benets over previous work the fact that it is more strongly grounded in real factual knowledge in this case wikipedia makes it hallucinate less with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability.  rag could be employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct benet to society, for example by endowing it with a medical index and asking it opendomain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more effective at their jobs.  with these advantages also come potential downsides wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge source, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias.  since rag can be employed as a language model, similar concerns as for gpt2 50 are valid here, although arguably to a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in the news or on social media to impersonate others or to automate the production of spamphishing content 54. advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the coming decades 16. in order to mitigate these risks, ai systems could be employed to ght against misleading content and automated spamphishing.  acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback on this paper, as well as huggingface for their help in opensourcing code to run rag models.  the authors would also like to thank kyunghyun cho and sewon min for productive discussions and advice.  ep thanks supports from the nsf graduate research fellowship.  pl is supported by the fair phd program.  references 1 payal bajaj, daniel campos, nick craswell, li deng, jianfeng gao, xiaodong liu, rangan majumder, andrew mcnamara, bhaskar mitra, tri nguyen, mir rosenberg, xia song, alina stoica, saurabh tiwary, and tong wang.  ms marco a human generated machine reading comprehension dataset.  arxiv1611.09268 cs, november 2016. url http arxiv.orgabs1611.09268.  arxiv 1611.09268.  2 petr baudi and jan edivy.  modeling of the question answering task in the yodaqa system.  in international conference of the crosslanguage evaluation forum for european languages, pages 222228. springer, 2015. url httpslink.springer.comchapter10.1007 2f978331924027520.  3 jonathan berant, andrew chou, roy frostig, and percy liang.  semantic parsing on freebase from questionanswer pairs.  in proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing, pages 15331544, seattle, washington, usa, october 2013. association for computational linguistics.  url httpwww.aclweb.organthology d131160.  4 bin bi, chenliang li, chen wu, ming yan, and wei wang.  palm pretraining an autoencodingautoregressive language model for contextconditioned generation.  arxiv, abs2004.07159, 2020. url httpsarxiv.orgabs2004.07159.  5 danqi chen, adam fisch, jason weston, and antoine bordes.  reading wikipedia to answer opendomain questions.',\n",

       " 'we nd that doing maximum inner product search with faiss is sufciently fast on cpu, so we store document index vectors on cpu, requiring 100 gb of cpu memory for all of wikipedia.  after submission, we have ported our code to huggingface transformers 663, which achieves equivalent performance to the previous version but is a cleaner and easier to use implementation.  this version is also opensourced.  we also compress the document index using faisss compression tools, reducing the cpu memory requirement to 36gb.  scripts to run experiments with rag can be found at httpsgithub.comhuggingfacetransformers blobmasterexamplesragreadme.md and an interactive demo of a rag model can be found at httpshuggingface.corag 2httpsgithub.compytorchfairseq 3httpsgithub.comhuggingfacetransformers 17 d further details on opendomain qa for opendomain qa, multiple answer annotations are often available for a given question.  these answer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer annotations are used to nd matches within documents when preparing training data.  for rag, we also make use of multiple annotation examples for natural questions and webquestions by training the model with each q, a pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy.  for triviaqa, there are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets, such as emoji or spelling variants.  for triviaqa, we lter out answer candidates if they do not occur in top 1000 documents for the query.  curatedtrec preprocessing the answers for curatedtrec are given in the form of regular expressions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answergeneration models 20. to overcome this, we use a preprocessing step where we rst retrieve the top 1000 documents for each query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision target.  if no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic generate all possible permutations for each regex, replacing nondeterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace.  triviaqa evaluation setups the opendomain qa community customarily uses public development datasets as test datasets, as test data for qa datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading compehension purposes.  we report our results using the datasets splits used in dpr 26, which are consistent with common practice in opendomain qa.  for triviaqa, this test dataset is the public triviaqa web development split.  roberts et al.  52 used the triviaqa ofcial wikipedia test set instead.  fvry et al.  14 follow this convention in order to compare with roberts et al.  52 see appendix of 14. we report results on both test sets to enable fair comparison to both approaches.  we nd that our performance is much higher using the ofcial wiki test set, rather than the more conventional opendomain test set, which we attribute to the ofcial wiki test set questions being simpler to answer from wikipedia.  e further details on fever for fever classication, we follow the practice from 32, and rst regenerate the claim, and then classify using the representation of the nal hidden state, before nally marginalizing across documents to obtain the class probabilities.  the fever task traditionally has two subtasks.  the rst is to classify the claim as either \"supported\", \"refuted\" or \"not enough info\", which is the task we explore in the main paper.  fevers other subtask involves extracting sentences from wikipedia as evidence supporting the classication prediction.  as fever uses a different wikipedia dump to us, directly tackling this task is not straightforward.  we hope to address this in future work.  f null document probabilities we experimented with adding \"null document\" mechanism to rag, similar to realm 20 in order to model cases where no useful information could be retrieved for a given input.',\n",
       " 'here, if k documents were retrieved, we would additionally \"retrieve\" an empty document and predict a logit for the null document, before marginalizing over k 1 predictions.  we explored modelling this null document logit by learning i a document embedding for the null document, ii a static learnt bias term, or iii a neural network to predict the logit.  we did not nd that these improved performance, so in the interests of simplicity, we omit them.  for open msmarco, where useful retrieved documents cannot always be retrieved, we observe that the model learns to always retrieve a particular set of documents for questions that are less likely to benet from retrieval, suggesting that null document mechanisms may not be necessary for rag.  g parameters our rag models contain the trainable parameters for the bertbase query and document encoder of dpr, with 110m parameters each although we do not train the document encoder ourselves and 406m trainable parameters from bartlarge, 406m parameters, making a total of 626m trainable 18 table 7 number of instances in the datasets used.  a hidden subset of this data is used for evaluation task train development test natural questions 79169 8758 3611 triviaqa 78786 8838 11314 webquestions 3418 362 2033 curatedtrec 635 134 635 jeopardy question generation 97392 13714 26849 msmarco 153726 12468 101093 fever3way 145450 10000 10000 fever2way 96966 6666 6666 parameters.  the best performing \"closedbook\" parametric only opendomain qa model is t511b with 11 billion trainable parameters.  the t5 model with the closest number of parameters to our models is t5large 770m parameters, which achieves a score of 28.9 em on natural questions 52, substantially below the 44.5 that ragsequence achieves, indicating that hybrid parametricnonparametric models require far fewer trainable parameters for strong opendomain qa performance.  the nonparametric memory index does not consist of trainable parameters, but does consists of 21m 728 dimensional vectors, consisting of 15.3b values.  these can be easily be stored at 8bit oating point precision to manage memory and disk footprints.  h retrieval collapse in preliminary experiments, we observed that for some tasks such as story generation 11, the retrieval component would collapse and learn to retrieve the same documents regardless of the input.  in these cases, once retrieval had collapsed, the generator would learn to ignore the documents, and the rag model would perform equivalently to bart.  the collapse could be due to a lessexplicit requirement for factual knowledge in some tasks, or the longer target sequences, which could result in less informative gradients for the retriever.  perez et al.  46 also found spurious retrieval results when optimizing a retrieval component in order to improve performance on downstream tasks.  i number of instances per dataset the number of training, development and test datapoints in each of our datasets is shown in table 7.  19']"
